## About Us

CBC was founded in 1874 as Chinese Mission by a group of believers from First Baptist Church in Portland, Oregon, in cooperation with a Chinese pastor from San Francisco, California.

With guidance from the Holy Spirit, the Chinese Mission served the Chinese immigrant community in Portland from their Old Town Portland location until ____, when the Chinese Mission became an independent church and was renamed Chinese Baptist Church.

In looking to serve a greater concentration of the Chinese community, CBC purchased a plot of land in Portland’s historic Ladd’s Addition and built its own facility, opening its doors in the winter of 1949.

Over 135 years later, CBC continues to serve the community by Christ’s grace.
