## The Dragon: A Living Symbol of Spirit and Strength

In Chinese culture, the dragon is not a beast to be feared, but a symbol to be celebrated.  
It embodies power without tyranny, wisdom without arrogance, and strength guided by purpose.  
The dragon dances not just to dazzle, but to unite—bringing people together in joy, pride, and cultural spirit.  

It carries the hopes of a people, the blessings of prosperity, and the legacy of a thousand years.  
To follow the dragon is to walk with courage.  
To become the dragon is to rise with honor.  

## Organizers

Initiated by the Oregon Chinese Coalition (OCC), supported by [CCBA](https://www.oregonccba.org/) and [OTCA](https://www.pdxoldtown.org/), and embraced by the community, this is a join effort by many community partners -- carrying the spirit of the dragon.
