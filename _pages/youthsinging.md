Portland Harmonics was founded in 2024 to perform at the "[Bing in the New Year](https://binginthenewyear.com/)" event in the City of Milwaukie. The group discovered a shared passion for singing and decided to continue as a community choir. During the Lunar New Year events, they showcased a strong sense of camaraderie and support for one another while making remarkable progress in their performances.
