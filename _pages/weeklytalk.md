How To Talk So Your Teen Will Listen

{% include feature_row id="feature_row21"%}

Carl Shan is the son of immigrants from mainland China. His family moved to the Bay Area when he was 5 years old. He grew up navigating the two different cultures, and often fought with his parents. Now that Carl is an older (and slightly wiser) 28 years-old, he volunteers as a workshop leader to help parents understand their teens and build stronger, healthier relationships. He spent 3 years working as a high school teacher, where he developed many techniques for supporting teens while holding them accountable.

He holds a BA in Statistics from UC Berkeley and works as a Senior Data Scientist at LinkedIn. His workshops have reached over 1,500 parents.

Christie Lin grew up in the Bay Area and Taipei before moving to the East Coast to attend Harvard. While in college, she encountered many Asian American peers who struggled with mental health despite their outward “success.” Many of their challenges were tied to their relationships with their parents, and she began to see intergenerational communication as critical to the mental wellbeing of many young adults. After graduating, Christie moved back to the Bay Area, where she ran panels and other initiatives to share the 2nd generation experience with parents. She now works at BetterUp, a startup that helps individuals build self-awareness and communication skills through coaching.

Chloe grew up in the East Bay, studied Statistics and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, and now works as a Senior Software Engineer at a nonprofit tech company. As a teen, Chloe had repeated awful fights with her mother over small things and felt a deep loss of connection. Now, after having spent many years improving communication with her parents and healing wounds from her teenage years, she is passionate about helping other families similarly rebuild their relationships. She has previously conducted workshops with parents in the Bay Area on how to connect with their teenage children across generational and cultural gaps.

Here are the typical questions from concerned parents:

"How come my teen is on their phone and computer so much?"  
"Why doesn't my daughter share about her life with me?"  
"Why does my teen make so may bad decisions?"  

This workshop is intended for parents who struggle to understand their teen. The workshop is led by former teens who want to see parents and their children build healthier relationships. The workshop will cover the following topics:

1. Why do teenagers behave badly?  
2. Five techniques to get your teen to listen to you  
3. Q&A with former teens

Parenting under the Pandemic -- 7 Habits of Highly Effective Parents

{% include feature_row id="feature_row20"%}

Under the sudden epidemic, home isolation has entered its tenth month, and normal school is still nowhere in sight. The results statistics of the fall semester show that the drawbacks of distance education are gradually emerging. For example, a report released by the Sequoia Union High School District in Silicon Valley shows that the number of students who failed at least one course has soared from 19.7% in 2019 to the current 29%, a growth rate of nearly 50%. The failure rate of high school students in the Healdsburg Unified School District is currently 39%, almost twice that of normal years. Distance teaching poses great challenges for most students, and it also challenges the patience and love of Chinese parents who have always valued education.

Way to Happiness-Family Psychological Self-Help Guide

{% include feature_row id="feature_row20"%}

Tomorrow's talk can also be seen as an extension of last week's topic, which will delve into happiness. Because more than 60 years of research has found that happiness is significantly positively correlated with academic performance and drive. Under positive emotions, the thinking from four-year-old children to adults is more open, more creative, more efficient in learning, more tolerant and friendly, and more popular with people around them. A positive family environment can help children reach their full potential! Therefore, in order to cultivate happy children, parents must improve their wellbeing. The talk is to help you how to apply the scientific findings of positive psychology in parenting practice, especially to maintain optimism under the pressure of the epidemic, improve physical and mental health, and set an example for children.

What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Stronger! -	Youth Suicide Prevention

{% include feature_row id="feature_row20"%}

Julie Xie, Ph.D., Licensed Educational Psychologist in CA, School Psychologist at Fremont United School District since 2000. Her Positive Parenting and Positive Youth video lessons have benefited hundreds of families during the pandemic.

Suicide is not caused by one "reason", but has different risk factors, and then a trigger induces it. The trigger for suicide among teenagers is often "disappointment, failure, rejection, etc., such as poor test results or family turmoil."

We cannot keep our children living in a vacuum and block out all stress and failure forever. Resilience is the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or significant sources of stress. Resilience involves not only “bouncing back” from these difficult experiences, but also profound personal growth.

How to strengthen our children’s resilience, enhancing the joy and meaning of life while defending the inevitable frustrations and adversity that comes with being?
