## The Dragon: A Living Symbol of Spirit and Strength

In Chinese culture, the dragon is not a beast to be feared, but a symbol to be celebrated.  
It embodies power without tyranny, wisdom without arrogance, and strength guided by purpose.  
The dragon dances not just to dazzle, but to unite—bringing people together in joy, pride, and cultural spirit.  

It carries the hopes of a people, the blessings of prosperity, and the legacy of a thousand years.  
To follow the dragon is to walk with courage.  
To become the dragon is to rise with honor.

For many Chinese families and communities, especially among older generations, it's a way to gather, chat, and strengthen relationships.

[Ping Pong (Table tennis)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis) is so popular in China that it’s a common sight in schools, parks, and offices, with people of all ages playing both casually and competitively.

Location: CCBA Hall, 315 NW Davis St (north side of the stage)
