## 给社区老人发送印有热线电话和编号的安全口哨

为能更好服务社区，OCC决定给社区老人发送印有热线电话(503-334-1010)和编号的安全口哨。假设老人在市中心走丢，凭着身上的热线电话和编号，我们可以及时联系到家人并在最短时间内根据提供的周边信息找到老人，这一切都是老人不会英语甚至普通话的情况下可以做到的。目前暂时开放给在市中心老年人公寓居住老人，欢迎家人们为老人填写需要的[信息表格](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZ0rxnIFec4ophgt0He00ofv6X2Lj6JE5PfgHTfn0pP8fpog/viewform?usp=sf_link)。

To start a new chapter for serving the community, we will send a whistle and keychain with engraved support line and unique ID number to community members. Imagine an elderly gets lost in downtown. With the help of the support and ID number, we can contact the family in no time and provide the basic information to the first responders. This becomes possible even the elderly does not speak English or only speak Taishanese. Currently it is open to the elderly living in downtown senior apartments. Family members are welcome to fill in the [required information form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZ0rxnIFec4ophgt0He00ofv6X2Lj6JE5PfgHTfn0pP8fpog/viewform?usp=sf_link).
