If you want to join our mentorship program, either as a mentor or mentee, please [contact us](http://pdxchinese.org/contact/). All  prospective mentees are required to fill out the [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqvee6XxvmWx8VpyCZu_s-o17OdQXv-5CVznpoapuYV3mRqQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) and then contact us.

## Community Mentors

We encourage community members to become a mentor for our kids. Mentoring is always a huge gap in our community. We all know it but always lack of actions. Don't need to be perfect, you can gain experience along the way. Nothing in this world can be more rewarded than growing up with the kids around you.

| All mentors are encouraged to have one initial face to face meeting with their mentees and then develop future meeting plans including communications via social media or emails if needed. Considering the capacity of mentors, each mentor may only take a few mentees at a time. |

Mentors have agreed to follow all [mentoring program guidelines and code of conduct](/assets/pdf/OCC Mentor Guidances and Code of Conduct 2019.pdf).

The website is full of resources. Both mentors and mentees are encouraged to explore the site to get the most out of this experience.

### [Youth.Gov](https://youth.gov/youth-topics/mentoring/)

'Mentoring provides youth with mentors who can develop an emotional bond with the mentee, have greater experience than the mentee, and can provide support, guidance, and opportunities to help youth succeed in life and meet their goals (DuBois and Karcher, 2005).'

### [MasterClass.com](https://www.masterclass.com/)

A master class is a class given to students of a particular discipline by an expert of that discipline—usually music, but also painting, drama, any of the arts, or on any other occasion where skills are being developed.

### [Mentoring.org](https://www.mentoring.org/)

MENTOR fuels the quantity and quality of mentoring relationships for the world's young people while closing the mentoring gap.
