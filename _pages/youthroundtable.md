## Agenda

### 12pm - 1pm: Social Lunch Hour Open to All Participants as well as Parents

It’s time to celebrate what our youth have accomplished over the past year both within our community as well as in the broader community.

### 1pm - 2pm: CVSA Ceremony with Motivational Speeches by Distinguished Guests

Congratulations to [CVSA recipients](https://pdxchinese.org/pvsa/) OCC helped certify in 2025!  

### 2pm - 4pm: Peer Social and Support Hour with Middle and High School Students

Peer mentorship is an excellent way for middle and high school students to learn from individuals with lived or current experiences in areas that may be of concern to them. Mentors can cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to college applications, college life, internships, scholarships, career planning, job market insights by field or industry, as well as mental health, leadership development, and even current political issues.

### 2pm - 4pm: Candid Conversation with Parents

With the potential impact of AI on job markets for new college graduates, parents are more anxious than ever. The conversations can span a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to) school choices, extracurriculars, leadership development, camp opportunities, college applications, majors, and even/surely mental health.
