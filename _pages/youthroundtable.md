## Agenda

### 11am - 11:30pm A song dedicated to OCC and community: *You're on my mind*

Composed by Aaron, a high schooler in local community.

### 11:30am - 1pm: College & Post-Graduate Social Lunch Hour

This space is reserved for college students and recent graduates. The questions on their minds and the challenges they face are very different from those they encountered in high school. A light lunch will be provided.

### 1pm - 2pm: Award Ceremony and Social Mingling for All Participants

*Middle and high school students are expected to arrive at 1pm*

Congratulations to [2025 Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) recipients](https://pdxchinese.org/pvsa/)! Medals and certificates will be presented to recipients with Portland Harmonics group performing *You Raise Me Up*.

### 2pm - 4pm: Structured Roundtable Session for All Participants

Peer mentorship is an excellent way for middle and high school students to learn from individuals with lived or current experiences in areas that may be of concern to them. Mentors can cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to college applications, college life, internships, scholarships, career planning, job market insights by field or industry, as well as mental health, leadership development, and even current political issues.

### 2pm - 4pm: Candid Conversation with Parents

With the potential impact of AI on job markets for new college graduates, parents are more anxious than ever. The conversations can span a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to) school choices, extracurriculars, leadership development, camp opportunities, college applications, majors, and even/surely mental health.
