>Before PVSA resumes, OCC has decided to present the **Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA)** — previously the PVSA Equivalent Award for Non-Resident Volunteers — to all volunteers. We will follow the same timeline, standards, and procedures as the PVSA certification process. The application will be available approximately one week after the end of the current cycle (October 27 through October 26).

Congratulations to the youth OCC has assisted **so far** in certifying their volunteering hours for the Community Volunteer Service Awards (CVSA). In one year, they have contributed hundreds of hours in supporting the community, aiding vulnerable individuals, and extending helping hands to their peers. These individuals share a common passion for service, each contributing in their unique way. Together, their stories paint a complete picture of our next generation growing up with love from the community and reciprocating that love by giving back to the community.
