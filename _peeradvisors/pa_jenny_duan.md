Jenny Duan is a junior at Jesuit High School, where she plays the piano in the jazz band! She is a co-leader of the Asian Student Union, and is a member of the Diversity and Inclusion Student Council. She is motivated by the community and people around her, and is highly interested in identifying and breaking down systemic barriers through advocacy with Rose Haven, a local
women’s shelter, and OMSI. Outside of school, Jenny loves to explore new restaurants in Portland, watch anime, and read books.

Community building is extremely important to Jenny, and she loves meeting and making new friends with people from diverse backgrounds.

Jenny has been tutoring peers and younger students since the start of high school, and most recently taught a free SAT prep course over the summer accessible to all high school students. She is excited to apply her experience and interest in building connection through her role as a peer advisor.
