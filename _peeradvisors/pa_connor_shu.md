Connor is currently a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania. He is pursuing a BA in Physics and a BSE in Systems Science and Engineering as part of the Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER). Connor is passionate about building a sustainable future and preserving this beautiful planet of ours. He loves nature and is always down for a hike!

As an instructor at Mathletics, Connor has had the pleasure of working with students of various ages and backgrounds. Besides teaching classes in a group setting, Connor has one-on-one tutored students as well. Oftentimes, Connor finds that he learns more from teaching his students than his students learn from him! Now, Connor hopes to use his experience working with students as a teacher to help them in a more personal way.

If you ever feel the need to talk to someone about anything, don't be scared! Please reach out to Connor or any of the other peer advisors. We don't bite; I promise :)
