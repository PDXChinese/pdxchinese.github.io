Sophia Pi is a junior at Jesuit High School, where she is the Editor-in-Chief of Jesuit’s newsletter, The Pulse. She is also an active member of the Jesuit Science Bowl team and the Ethics Bowl team, and leads the Portland Junior Scientists Club. Sophia was motivated to combine her interests through her service work aimed at uplifting the educational needs of underrepresented students.

She has been volunteering in Title One schools (schools where over 40% of students are from low-income families) since she was in middle school to inspire students from diverse backgrounds to explore science and engineering. She co-founded a nonprofit, Actions4Solutions, through which she initiated a PPE drive and online STEM activities during the pandemic. She also tutored online ethics classes and mathematics classes to support students in a difficult year.

She is constantly inspired by the people in the community and by the people she has been fortunate enough to meet through her various experiences, from young children in underprivileged schools with extraordinary persistence to world-renowned leaders. She sincerely believes that everyone can make the world a better place through their day to day actions, big or small.

Sophia knows the importance of having someone with open ears, ready to listen. She really enjoys making new friendships and she can’t wait to talk to you! :)
