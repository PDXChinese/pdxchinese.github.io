## Message

Beside a clear stream, a girl lies quietly, as if she has merged into this pure land undisturbed by the spectacular world. Her sleeping face is peaceful and beautiful, as if a soul has found its home under the gentlest comfort of nature. The stream flows gently, bringing the freshness and vitality of the mountains and forests, adding a bit of agility to this peaceful picture. She is not only a viewer of nature, but also its guardian. Her existence seems to be telling a story about harmony and protection, reminding everyone who passes by that this beauty and tranquility need us to cherish and maintain together. In her sleeping dream, perhaps this is an infinite yearning of the green earth, a deep attachment to the clear water source, and an earnest hope that future generations can breathe freely under this blue sky. Her sleeping posture is an intoxication with the beauty of nature and a deep understanding of its fragility.
