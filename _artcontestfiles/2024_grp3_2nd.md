## Message

My artwork captures the beauty of the animals in the sea forest, from fish to otters, all delicate and interesting. I wanted to capture how if one animal is missing the whole food chain would be broken. The otter is a great part of the ocean making sure no fish, clam or sea urchin is over populated.
