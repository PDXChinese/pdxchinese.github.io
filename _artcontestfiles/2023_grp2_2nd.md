## Message

Often times, I found myself feeling anxious, so I painted and it always helped lift my mood and calm me down. But sometimes, I had no inspiration for the painting. After I learned about the healing powers of nature, I decided to try painting outside. I began to feel a lot more relaxed.

I created this painting to show how nature can inspire and heal.
