## Message

There are many lovely elves in nature, such as cute rabbits, beautiful ducks, well-behaved otters, and pretty birds. Each of these elves is a gift from nature to the world. It is because of the existence of so many lovely little animals that the world is so beautiful. There are also beautiful flowers, tall trees, and green grass, all of which are alive. We should be best friends with animals, flowers, and plants.
