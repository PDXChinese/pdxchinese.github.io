## Message

When I See this painting I think of how beautiful nature is and the way people react when they see it. I imagine how the eye peeking through is must have felt. When I was working on this painting I noticed all of the creases and curves Mt. Hood has and was in aweof how unique nature can be. While I was sketching the deer I discovered how strong deers can be with all of its muscles. I hope you will find the beauty of nature.
