## Message

Just like how we desire a beautiful and peaceful world, wildlife also longs for a safe home to live in. However, many species of animals and plants are being endangered because of littering, deforestation, pollution, and more! So how about we work together to cherish animals and protect the environment so we can create a beautiful home for all!
