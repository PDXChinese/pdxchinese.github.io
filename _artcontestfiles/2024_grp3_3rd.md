## Message

Whenever I am floating in the river, I feel rested and recovered. Letting the water bring me wherever it wants me to is relaxing and peaceful. Floating in a tube lazily gives me an outlet of my feelings and gathers my thought. It also makes me feel part of my surrounding, part of the river and part of the nature. Floating in the river also lets me see things that I donâ€™t usually see when I swim or at the bank. I am able to get much closer to them as I am part of them now.
