## Message

This scene is inspired by the tour walk my family and I attended in 2022 at the Tualatin River National Wildlife Refuge. When walking through the forest, I feel calm in my surroundings, engulfed by the trees and natural sounds. Every element of nature is alive and vibrant in its own way, spreading awareness that we humans can depend on it to maintain calm and realize our whereabouts.
