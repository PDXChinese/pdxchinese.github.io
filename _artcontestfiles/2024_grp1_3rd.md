## Message

Often in life, you will find yourself overwhelmed by work and stress and just want to find some calm. In the quiet of the outdoors, nature offers a kind of escape. The girl sitting on the wall with her cat represents times when you just need to take a breath of fresh air and spend some time outside to feel grounded again.
