## Message

This piece reflects how I view the wildlife here in Portland, Oregon. Growing up surrounded by wildlife and nature, these aspects are crucial to my daily life. The different animals in this piece are all animals I've seen in my day-to-day life in Oregon, whether I’d be looking out the window while riding the bus to school, visiting the coast, or going on hikes in one of the hundreds of nature parks in this state I have the chance to come across one of these animals. My vision, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings are all fueled by my love for nature in Oregon and I felt that the best way for me to express my appreciation was by including a piece of me in this painting.
