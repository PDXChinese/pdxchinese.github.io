## Message

In the eye of the wildfire, once verdant shrubbery has been scorched merely into black ash. But spring is coming, and decay does not last forever. Trees will continue to grow, and life will continue to flourish. Though darkness is temporary, the resilience that runs through every animal's veins is not.
