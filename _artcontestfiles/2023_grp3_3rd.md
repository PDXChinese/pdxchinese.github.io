## Message

I prefer a quiet and peaceful life. My sister and I would always sit on the patio in the backyard and gaze at the beautiful landscape. Occasionally, there would be squirrels on the wooden railings, and especially a Blue Jay would commonly fly near us, like a morning routine!!! My sister and I are learning to play the guitar. I really hope that one day, I can play for these lovely, cute animals. If we can protect the environment, we can always enjoy such a quiet, peaceful, and beautiful life.
