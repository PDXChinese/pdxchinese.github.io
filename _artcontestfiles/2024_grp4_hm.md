## Message

I love to swing. Last year, my mom let me swing in the rain and under a rainbow because I lost my favorite stuffy at school. I was very sad. My mom told me the light spring rain would wash all my sadness away, wake up the sleeping trees and flowers, and the rainbow would sprinkle magic powder on earth to bring life back again.  I was all better later that night because my sadness was all washed away and I was going to get a new stuffy.
