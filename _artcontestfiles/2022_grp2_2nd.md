## Message

I was inspired by all the times I had in nature, experiencing the outdoors with my family. A few years ago, I got the chance to go cherry-picking. Although we are taking things away from nature, we are learning about it and spending time in it. The different animals in this painting represent the common species of wildlife that live in the Tualatin Valley area.
