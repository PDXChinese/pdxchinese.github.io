This front page article by Jaimie Ding well documented the efforts by community advocates, including local Chinese Americans, to bring the dream come true by building the Cultural Heritage Garden in Block 14 of Lone Fir Cemetery in memory of the Chinese workers who helped build the infrastructure of our nation. The funding commitment by Metro Council on the project came at the right time when the contribution of the early Chinese immigrants were largely forgotten and when today’s Chinese Americans have been scapegoated for the pandemic. We thank The Oregonian Editorial Board for publishing this article and giving people an opportunity to reflect on what makes our nation great.
