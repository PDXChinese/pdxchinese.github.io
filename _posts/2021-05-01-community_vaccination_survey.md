author: XiBei Zhao
excerpt: "Totally 96.4% respondents have received at least the first dose. Among three vaccines, 75.4% received Pfizer. Those who have made up their mind not getting vaccinated is less than 1%. With those who had not made up their mind, the percentage is only 2.3%. The number of people who have received the vaccination is way higher than what we had expected. This survey result is definitely going to help those who haven’t made up their mind to move forward with the vaccination."

Totally 96.4% respondents have received at least the first dose. Among three vaccines, 75.4% received Pfizer. Those who have made up their mind not getting vaccinated is less than 1%. With those who had not made up their mind, the percentage is only 2.3%. The number of people who have received the vaccination is so encouraging. This survey result is definitely going to help those who haven’t made up their mind to move forward with the vaccination. The whole community is dashing to the finish line.

Community members expressed their gratitude to all the vaccination opportunities provided to BIPOC communities. The strategy adopted by OHA and counties has been working very well in getting the resources to the communities that have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic.
