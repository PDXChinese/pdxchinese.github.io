# Levin Liu - Silver Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 78.5**  

Levin is a sophomore in the Portland, Oregon area who currently attends Sunset High School. He’s a member of FTC team 12808, RevAmped Robotics, and loves mechanical design and CAD. Through RevAmped, he spreads STEAM to underserved communities. To him, this work is incredibly meaningful, as he knows that not everyone has the same access to technology.

Outside of robotics, Levin volunteers at the Oregon Food Bank and the Hillsboro Library. He’s a member of Sunset’s Cross Country and Track team. He also plays cello. He’s grateful for the opportunities he’s had to make a difference and is passionate about giving back to his community. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Levin Liu.
