# Eric Zhao - Silver Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 78**  

Eric is a sophomore at Sunset High School. He is involved in a robotics team, helping to mentor and inspire kids not only already in STEM fields, but also kids who aren’t. He helps give them opportunities to show the intriguing aspects of robotics & STEM, demonstrating their robot and helping boost other people’s knowledge in STEM, enabling them to have a bigger and better impact on the world. When he’s not inspiring other kids, he likes to use his STEM knowledge & his passion for 3D printing to make projects.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Eric Zhao.
