# Arianna Hong - Gold Award

**School: BASE**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 148**  

Arianna Hong, a sixth grader studying at BASE. I am part of the OCC Diabolo Team, and together, we share and connect with the community. As a team, we support and encourage each other, and contribute our strength to various community service projects. Through performances, we share our love for Chinese culture and inspire others to join us. Our team has performed at events like the Youth Conference, El Sol Festival, and the Chinese Festival. One of the most meaningful moments for me was at the Chinese Festival, where, in addition to performing, my sister and I stayed throughout the event. We introduced our diabolos, spoke about the Chinese language, shared traditional cultural insights, and emphasized the peace-loving values of our heritage with those who are passionate about Chinese culture.

I created several videos and posters for the OCC events. Some of them were for the Winter Drive, OCC Drum team, Hanging up red lanterns, OCC Diabolo team, and many more!

Last year, I participated in a community winter drive. Through this event, I helped collect warm clothing, blankets, and other essential items for people in need during the cold season. It is important to support the ones in need, especially when they are struggling with harsh winter weather, and I want to do my part to bring warmth and comfort to those who need it most.

I also participated in the BSD Clothes for Kids event, where we sort out clothes for kids that need them. 

By giving back to my community, I hope to make it a better place for everyone. Whether it is through sharing my culture by promoting it with my performances or helping the ones in need, I will always look for ways to contribute. I am excited to continue learning, growing, and sharing with others in the future.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Arianna Hong.
