# Jessie Pan - Gold Award

**School: Lake Oswego High School**

**Hours: 106.5**  

"I am currently a sophomore at Lake Oswego High School. For me, my main goal was to help out others in my community & make a difference in this world.

During my fifth grade year, I learned how to code Java. Soon after, I followed my mentor’s footsteps and started to also teach new students and relay my information over to them. I have been currently teaching for over two years - one of my biggest accomplishments is having students understand what I’m teaching and apply their knowledge to their future classes. Having students ask me questions without hesitation is also a great feeling, because this indicates that they’re comfortable enough to seek help. I wish to help out as much as possible.

I am also a member of the VisionEnvoy branch of the Lake Oswego Lions Club. I love helping out with the club’s various events, ranging from organizing/hosting various fundraisers to wearing traditional Chinese clothing & spreading the word about ancient Chinese culture/traditions. I want to raise awareness about our club, and continue to help out the community in many different ways."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Jessie Pan.
