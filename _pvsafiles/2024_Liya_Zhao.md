Liya Zhao is currently a freshman at Camas High School. She is an active member of various
high school clubs including the Red Cross, Key Club, Scientific Outreach Club, Science

film, design, and write short speeches for the final video, providing students and their families
with a more personalized, memorable graduation. In addition, she has also dedicated time to
