# Kevin Lin - Bronze Award

**School: West Linn High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 52**  

My name is Kevin Lin. I’m 15 years old and current at West Linn High in 10th grade. I love computer science and music. I’m current playing in symphonic band at West Linn high school and Portland Youth Philharmonic. I have a lot of funs to play percussion and drums. 
This summer, I had a chance to participate Hanfu culture through OCC and Kerry Yu Laoshi fashion group. It is not only a great opportunity for me to learn Chinese Culture in deep manner, but also to introduce the Chinese Culture for the tourists who visit in Lansu Chinses Garden. 
In August, I had a great opportunity to design the flyers for August Chinese Festival in Pioneer Courthouse square. Besides spending time to get familiar with the design software, I had to do lots of research regarding the Chinese cultures, especially the Chinese traditional games. This is the first time I learned the Chinese traditions from the amazing ancient games and my research. I was proud of designing the flyers after gaining more knowledge about the Chinese cultures.
Thanks to OCC giving me amazing volunteer opportunities. I wish I could have more volunteer opportunities to make more people aware of Chinese cultures on next year.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Kevin Lin.
