Benjamin is a freshman at Westview High School who is always eager to lend a hand. In 2025, he dedicated his time to a wide variety of volunteer events, demonstrating both commitment and compassion. At local Chinese festivals, he assisted with setup, cleaning, and even participated in dragon dancing, contributing to the vibrant community spirit. Beyond cultural events, Benjamin shares his musical talent as a pianist with the group Beats of Bethany, bringing joy to elderly audiences through live performances.

His volunteer work also extends to environmental stewardship, where he helped remove invasive blackberry brambles at the Tualatin River National Wildlife Refuge. In addition, he supported Bridge City Inclusive Sports by maintaining wheelchairs. Whether through music, environmental care, or hands-on assistance, Benjamin embraces every opportunity to serve. He finds fulfillment in helping others and consistently strives to give his best in every role.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Benjamin Zhang.
