# Haruki Kato - Bronze Award

**School: Mountainside High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 71**  

Haruki is a sophomore at Mountainside High School who exemplifies adaptability and commitment to service. After relocating from Japan to the United States in December 2024, she quickly embraced her new environment and actively sought opportunities to contribute.

Haruki participated in diverse volunteer activities, reflecting her passion for cultural exchange and community engagement. She assisted with setup and cleanup at Portland’s Chinese cultural festival, Return of the Dragon, and performed the Dragon Dance alongside other volunteers. She also supported the Japanese Summer Festival (Natsu Matsuri) at the Japanese International Baptist Church, fostering connections across cultures.

Beyond cultural events, Haruki demonstrated dedication to environmental stewardship by removing invasive plants at Tualatin Hills Nature Center, Jenkins Estate, Kennedy Community Garden, Mountain View Champions Park, and Cedar Hills Nature Center. She further contributed to community initiatives by maintaining wheelchairs for Bridge City Inclusive Sports and assisting Clothes for Kids at the BSD Administrative Office.

Through every role—whether promoting cultural understanding, caring for the environment, or supporting local programs—Haruki consistently shows initiative, resilience, and a genuine desire to make a positive impact.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Haruki Kato.
