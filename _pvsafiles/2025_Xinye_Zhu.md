# Xinye Zhu - Gold Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 103**  

Xinye is a freshman currently attending Lincoln High School who is passionate about her surrounding environment. Since the start of her volunteering journey in middle school, she has always strived to make a positive impact, however she can. From after-school dance class help to mentoring her school’s growing robotics team, Xinye has dedicated the past five years of her time to uplifting and expanding her community. Outside of school, she is a researcher, writer, and member of an organization called STEM Beyond Boundaries, focusing on inspiring the world about all things STEM. Within the team, she is also one of the many dedicated members of Stem Sparks Reads– publishing and printing a monthly newsletter that hopes to spark curiosity for the younger generation about the innovative world of all things science. And even within her local
neighborhood, Xinye is the secretary of the Forest Heights Youth Leadership Committee, where they meet and assemble engaging events to bring the community together. Tapping into the creative space, she explores her personal expression as a member of the 2025 Portland Public Schools Dance Honors Collective, the first to be created in the Portland Public Schools district. Within Lincoln High School, Xinye is a member of the
dance team, Pink Valley Dance Team, where they meet and practice regularly to inspire dancers through their flashy and precise dance pieces.

Xinye is very excited to explore new opportunities as she begins her high school years, and hopes to continue giving and volunteering– doing what she loves!

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Xinye Zhu.
