# Emily Liu - Gold Award

**School: Springville Elementary School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 125**  

I am a student from Springville Elementary and love to dance, draw, play piano, and play tennis (my favorite sport). My mom always invites me to volunteer at OCC. Soon, I got very interested in volunteering for the people in the community.

I have volunteered for the Conexbox, Winter Drive, Lan Su Chinese Garden, and the Chinese Festival. My favorite times are when I get to do
something instead of waiting and being bored. When I started volunteering at OCC, I realized that I had a lot of skills for how to make good conversations with the people in the community. One of my favorite times of volunteering is tidying Lan Su Chinese Garden.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Emily Liu.
