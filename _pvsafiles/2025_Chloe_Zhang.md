# Chloe Zhang - Gold Award

**School: Sherwood High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 102.75**  

Chloe is a sophomore at Sherwood High School, and throughout the past year, she's engaged in service in a wide variety of fields. Over the Thanksgiving and winter breaks, she played violin at several nursing homes, delivering passionate performances to the residents, and volunteers regularly at the nearest one. She also handles announcements at the occasional home meet for the Chehalem Swim Team, working to keep swimmers and parents on track and informed. She has participated in various service projects with OCC, engaging visitors to the Health Fair and cleaning the mosaic tile floor of the Lansu Chinese Garden. With her local Scouting America troop, she contributed to multiple Eagle Projects and served at the St. Anthony's community dinner, as well as packaged meals at the Oregon Food Bank - an activity that she has also participated in with her school's Key Club, an organization dedicated to service. While in Key Club, she's volunteered at the Willowbrook Food Pantry - returning to it multiple times throughout the year - and at the Sherwood Center for the Arts, lending a hand (or both hands) wherever necessary as she assists with setting up and running events.

Outside of her volunteer time, Chloe loves reading; to her, each new book is a world with layers of secrets to uncover, all of which will be revealed in good time. She is an active member of her school's Youth and Government club, in addition to being on the Mock Trial team. When
not playing violin, reading, or petting her neighbor's cat, she can be found talking with her friends and working with them on whichever ambitious project they choose to tackle next.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Chloe Zhang.
