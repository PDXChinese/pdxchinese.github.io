# Lucas Zhang - Gold Award

**School: Catlin Gabel School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 206**  

Lucas is an intellectually minded sophomore at Catlin Gabel who has approached many avenues of volunteering across many fields over the past year, as well as being a large part of a variety of events. Working with his local community, he has formed the OCC-affiliated music performance group Portland Harmonics, performing at many cultural events, including the Bing in the New Year and the Return of the Dragon events. In addition, he has spent a large amount of time on the topic of the Chinese section at Lone Fir Cemetery's Block 14, a place of great historic discrimination and where a memorial is being planned. Over the last year, he has researched the topic extensively, creating a documentary which at  National History Day was awarded best entry from Oregon. Through this, he has spoken at events organized by Oregon Metro, the Oregon CCBA, and the Portland C.A.C.A. to shed more light on the topic of Block 14 and highlight its importance. In addition, he has continued to work as a part of the local non-profit Youth Cyber Defender to provide small businesses with cybersecurity assessments.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Lucas Zhang.
