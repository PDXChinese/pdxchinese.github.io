# Ella Chen - Silver Award

**School: Rosemont Ridge MIddle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 76**  

Ella is an 8th grade student at Rosemont Ridge Middle School who is deeply committed to helping others and giving back to her community. She has volunteered at OCC, her school, and the library, where she consistently shows kindness, responsibility, and a willingness to support those around her.

One of Ella’s most meaningful volunteer experiences was helping prepare dinners for individuals experiencing homelessness at the Clark Transition Center. Through this experience, she learned that everyone may need support at different moments in life, and she found great fulfillment in being able to help those in need.

Ella hopes to continue serving her community and encouraging others to get involved in making a positive difference. Outside of school, she enjoys playing golf, playing the violin, and spending time with her friends.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Ella Chen.
