# Tsz Kit Lam - Gold Award

**School: PCC**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 264**  

Hi, my name is Tsz Kit Lam. I was studying at Portland Community College when I was in Oregon Health & Science University’s Healthcare Volunteer Summer Program. Currently, I am a Junior at the University of California, Los Angeles to continue pursuing my College degree. I am a Biochemistry Major and aiming to apply to medical school after receiving my Bachelor’s Degree at UCLA. As a Guide Volunteer in OHSU’s program, my responsibility is to guide our patient to the right department, gather wheelchairs in places available for patient, and restock the supply needed for patient, such as masks, hand sanitizer and the hospital’s map. This volunteer program is a very fruitful experience to expose myself into a real healthcare setting. My favourite part of it was the time when patient shared their personal life stories to me. I have gained more than just the satisfaction of helping others, but also life experience from their amazing stories. Being able to serve different diversity of knowledgeable person, this is my honour and favourite part of the program.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Tsz Kit Lam.
