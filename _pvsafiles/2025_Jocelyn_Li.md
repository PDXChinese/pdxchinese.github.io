# Jocelyn Li - Gold Award

**School: Catlin Gabel School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 137**  

This summer Jocelyn spent a large part of her time volunteering at OHSU. The work involved assisting patients in navigating the hospital, bringing them to multiple appointments, delivering flowers/gifts, and replenishing necessary supplies within the hospital. Following this interest in the medical field, she is a leader of HOSA and is on the executive council of the Knight Institute's Youth Cancer Champions. For both organizations, she has been involved in organizing the day-to-day logistics and major fundraisers.  She actively participates within the local Chinese community by helping at Chinese Culture PSU booths, volunteering for the annual Chinese New Year Gala, and cleaning the Lan Su Yuan Garden. Her interests cumulate within her role as a member of the Chinese Friendship Association of Portland's Youth Council, where they work to combat tobacco and health issues within the Chinese and youth populations.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Jocelyn Li.
