# Doris Hong - Gold Award

Doris is 15 years old and a current freshman at Lake Oswego High School, where she continues to build on a strong foundation of community service she developed over the past few years. Her volunteering journey began three years ago, after returning from Beijing, China. Adjusting to a new environment motivated her to get involved, connect with others, and give back to the community around her. Started as a small effort to help now grew into meaningful, long-term passion for leadership, cultural sharing and service.

During her 8th grade year at Hope Chinese Charter School, Doris took on a wide variety of volunteer roles and cultural responsibilities. She became actively involved by sharing Chinese culture through guzheng performances, public speaking, and traditional Chinese dance performances. She proudly represented her school and community at cultural festivals and was invited to perform and do speeches at multiple high schools and events, including the Chinese speech and performances event at Lincoln High School, the international event hosted at Beaverton city library, and the global fair and AREAA Gala event -even before becoming a high schooler herself.

In addition to cultural presentations, Doris took on hands-on, service-focused works. She volunteered at a sports camp, where she helped manage activities, support campers, and guide teams. During summer break, she served as teacher assistant, helping with classroom activities, supervising
younger children, and supporting teachers with lessons and organization. At Hope Chinese Charter School, she became known as someone who is always willing to help – Whether assisting at school events, preparing materials, or stepping up wherever support was needed.

However, this dedication still didn't stop even after she graduated. Even now, as a freshman at Lake Oswego High School, Doris continues to return to HCCS to volunteer at events and help teachers and younger students. Her continued involvement deeply reflects her appreciation for the school and her ongoing commitment to giving back.

She also remains active in cultural teams at OCC (Oregon Chinese Coalition), where she continues performing, volunteering, and supporting community cultural programs. Her work in the Phoenix Hanfu team and Dragonfly Yoyo team further expanded her cultural involvement. Through these groups, Doris performed Hanfu showcases, traditional dance, and yoyo displays at public celebrations and community events. Each performance allowed her to celebrate her heritage, inspire younger students, meet people, make new friends, and promote cultural understanding across diverse audiences.

Since middle school, Volunteering has become a definite part of Doris’s life. It has absolutely helped her grow confidence in leadership, express her culture with pride, and form meaningful connections with the community around her. Looking forward, Doris is excited to keep expanding her service work, seek new opportunities, and continue using her talents – whether through cultural arts or community support – to make a positive impact wherever she goes.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Doris Hong.
