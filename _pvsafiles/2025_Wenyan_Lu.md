In the past year, Lucy has focused her efforts on MusicMed, a student-led nonprofit organization that uses the power of music to uplift the lives of patients and seniors. As Executive Director, Lucy leads organization-wide meetings, coordinates volunteers, and organizes fundraising events and benefit concerts. Through MusicMed, Lucy combines her love of music with her dedication to uplifting patients and seniors in the community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Wenyan Lu.
