# Ray Yang - Silver Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 77**  

Ray is a Junior at Westview High School and loves working with kids of all age groups. Throughout the summer, Ray became a teacher at [Tech4Girls](https://www.tech4kidsclub.org/tech-for-girls), where the aim was to close the gender gap in STEM careers. He hosted online class sessions, where he taught Python. Every week, he would meet with the kids, where Ray had classwork planned, and guide them through it. He encouraged the students to ask questions, so they could grasp the concepts completely. He helped the students create goals that they would aim to accomplish every week. While the students learned how to program and write, he learned how to be a better teacher. Ray also volunteered at programs such as Science Ambassadors and [Science NHS](https://sciencenhs.org/), where he and his team would create projects that they would then teach to aspiring kids. Lastly, Ray recently became an organizer at [Unified Sports](https://soor.org/unified-sports/#:~:text=Unified%20Sports%20is%20an%20inclusive,teammates%20for%20training%20and%20competition.), where the goal was to provide a place students with intellectual disabilities could practice and compete in sporting events. Ray’s volunteering experience opened his eyes to the world around him, and he learned that everyone can make an impact on their community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ray Yang.
