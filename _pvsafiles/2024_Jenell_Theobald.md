Jenell, a senior at the International School of Beaverton, has been a dedicated advocate for disadvantaged groups since elementary school. She successfully pushed for the creation of the city's ADA Technical Advisory Committee and served as a member. Currently, she is the youngest and only high school student to have ever served on the state's Youth Development Council.
Each year, Jenell dedicates hundreds of hours to various service projects. In addition to her work on government committees and task forces, her long-term commitments include volunteering at Camp Meadowood Springs, a camp for children with special needs; at Transition Projects, shelters that assist individuals transitioning to permanent housing; at the Lone Fir Cemetery Cultural Heritage Garden, a memorial honoring the forgotten railroad workers who built the region's infrastructure over a century ago; and supporting her school community.
Driven by her own experiences, advocating for underserved groups has been Jenells lifelong passion. Her leadership and dedication have inspired many, leaving a lasting impact on the community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jenell Theobald.
