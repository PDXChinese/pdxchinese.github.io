# Brian Barker - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 290**  

Brian, a senior at Sunset High School, is a storyteller and community builder with a talent for bringing untold narratives and overlooked causes into the spotlight. Through creativity and service, he has become a passionate advocate for cultural preservation and a driving force behind efforts to foster vibrant, inclusive communities in Oregon.
At the Oregon Chinese Coalition (OCC), Brian wears many hats, from media team coordinator to photographer, videographer, and social media strategist. His work breathes life into key cultural events like the Chinese Festival, Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Races, and the Health Fair. Whether capturing the energy of a dragon boat slicing through the water or editing a festival highlight reel, Brians media production elevates the visibility of Chinese heritage, creating lasting connections across the state.
Brians impact stretches beyond cultural advocacy. As a Volunteer Screening Coordinator for the American Red Cross, he helps recruit and mentor new volunteers, shaping the next wave of humanitarian leaders. As a member of both the Sunset Red Cross and the International Humanitarian Law Youth Action Campaign, he champions global principles of compassion and justice while addressing local needs.
This year, Brian also brought his dedication to service into the heart of his community by preparing and serving meals at the Clark Center. Through every role he takes on, Brian remains guided by a singular vision: to unite people, uplift voices, and inspire action for causes that matter.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Brian Barker.
