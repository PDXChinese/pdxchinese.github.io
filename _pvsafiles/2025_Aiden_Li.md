# Aiden Li - Gold Award

**School: Crescent Valley High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 110**  

"Hi, my name is Aiden Li, and I am a freshman at Crescent Valley High School. My hobbies include playing soccer, fishing, and spending time with friends.

Most of my volunteer hours were related to soccer. I helped with TOPSoccer, a program that gives children and individuals with disabilities the opportunity to play soccer, and I also volunteered as a referee for AYSO. Soccer was a fun and meaningful way to help kids stay active while giving them a chance to build confidence and connect with others.
Volunteering through soccer felt like my way of giving back to the community because I wanted others to experience the game the same way I do. Through this experience, I learned that sometimes all you need is the opportunity to try something new, and you may end up discovering something you truly enjoy."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Aiden Li.
