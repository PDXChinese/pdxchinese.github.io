# Avery Neice - Brown Award

**School: Lake Oswego Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 51**  

Avery is an 8th grader at Lake Oswego Middle School. She loves to help out her community and make a positive impact.

One of Avery's favorite ways of helping out in her community is by volunteering at the Northwest Children's Outreach. There, she creates and puts together packs of supplies for kids in need. Her positive attitude and energy shows her dedication to helping others.

Avery also enjoys helping her community by putting together kits for the Lake Oswego Robotic Camps, whose mission is to provide kids with opportunities to explore robotics.

Throughout the year, Avery often volunteers at STEM Like A Girl. Here, she would introduce STEM to young girls and help spark interest in science. She also enjoyed being on their mentor panel where she discussed her experiences in STEM with the audience. She hopes her own enthusiasm about being a girl in STEM will leave a lasting impact on this community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Avery Neice.
