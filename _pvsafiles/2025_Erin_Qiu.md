# Erin Qiu - Gold Award

**School: Stoller Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 118**  

Erin is an 8th grader at Stoller Middle school. She has always had a passion for helping people in need, inspiring her to keep making positive impacts in her community. From a young age, she has always felt a need to help those who were struggling and facing challenges. Now, she volunteers at a food shelter in Downtown Portland, where she helps prepare and hand out meals to those in need. She finds the experience meaningful, and it makes her happy to see that even a small act of kindness can make someone’s day. Erin also passionately plays the violin, often performing at retirement homes. Sharing music she loves with the residents comforts her, especially when she sees the joy it brings them. In her free time, you can probably find her sleeping or playing video games.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Erin Qiu.
