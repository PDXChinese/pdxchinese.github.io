# Derek Zhao - Gold Award

**School: Lake Oswego High School**

**Hours: 113**  

"My name is Derek Zhao, and I am a student who is deeply committed to serving my community through long-term and consistent volunteer work. I was first introduced to volunteering through community organizations such as the Oregon Chinese Coalition and the Lion Club, where I learned the importance of giving back through both service and leadership. Over the past several years, I have volunteered in a wide range of activities, including cooking and serving meals at homeless shelters, supporting Lunar New Year and cultural celebrations, assisting with fundraising events, and helping organize community gatherings such as holiday parties and public performances.

In addition to event-based volunteering, I have been actively involved in ongoing service through the VisionEnvoy initiative, where I manage website operations and provide technology support for senior centers. This long-term commitment, averaging weekly involvement over nearly a year, has allowed me to directly support elderly community members by improving access to information and digital resources. Through volunteering, I have learned the value of responsibility, teamwork, and using my technical skills to help others. I believe volunteering is not only about contributing time, but about creating lasting impact, and I am motivated to continue serving my community with dedication, creativity, and care."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Derek Zhao.
