# Owen Ni - Bronze Award

**School: Lake Oswego High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 50**  

"I am a 9th grader at Lake Oswego High School. I love to help my community and make a positive impact on the areas which I am good at.
Starting my 8th grade summer, I spent around 2 weeks volunteering as an enthusiastic and dedicated camp counselor for a tennis program organized by Lake Oswego Park & Recreation Center each year. There, I created an engaging, safe, and inclusive environment for young campers, helped plan programs, collaborated with the head staff, and fostered positive relationships to promote personal growth and development among the campers. My summers at Lakeridge High School’s tennis courts hold some of my favorite memories, and I hope to continue to add more lasting memories as a volunteer for our local community.

In 2025, I became a member of the Lake Oswego Youth Action Council. The Youth Action Council works directly with Lake Oswego’s Parks & Recreation to plan, promote and implement community activities. It is an opportunity for me to define immediate and long-term needs in the community and attempt to meet those needs throughout the school year. From helping set up events like the Monster Mash to helping the community fundraise and make blankets, being a member of this council has been a wonderful experience that I hope to continue throughout the rest of my high school years."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Owen Ni.
