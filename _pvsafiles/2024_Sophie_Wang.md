Sophie finds the most fulfillment by serving her community through her public health efforts. As
Oregon HOSA’s State President, Sophie spends a lot of her time fulfilling her officer duties and
volunteering with her community in doing so. She additionally this past year founded her own initiative
geared towards eliminating the stigma associated with HPV, championing education and awareness in its
place. Sophie is also a proud board member of the Oregon School-Based Health Alliance where she
makes decisions on school-health services state-wide.
She is an avid community-connecter, and she is honored to be awarded for her efforts. In the future,
Sophie will continue to build on her leadership and make service the pillar of every endeavor.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Sophie Wang.
