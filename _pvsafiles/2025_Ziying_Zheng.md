# Ziying (Lindsay) Zheng - Gold Award

**School: Camas High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 162**  

"I am a sophomore at Camas High School. I am involved in a wide variety of sports and clubs in school like tennis, cross country, Science Olympiad, and knowledge bowl. I used my interest in knitting and crochet to found my own club that focuses on making blankets and plushies for hospitals and animal shelters. Additionally, outside of school, I volunteer at a local hospital and this opportunity has led me to learn so much about the medical field and I really enjoy talking with the patients there. Helping people has brought me lots of joy as I also help tutor and volunteer at various events around my community. These experiences helped me learn a lot and I really enjoy being involved in my community and helping it grow."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Ziying Zheng.
