# Yicheng Zhang - Gold Award

**School: Union High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 108**  

"I am a volunteer who loves public welfare. With an enthusiastic heart, I actively devote myself to various volunteer service activities, hoping to contribute my meager strength to the society. I have been involved in volunteer activities for more than 100 hours, during which I have been exposed to a variety of different volunteer projects. Among them, what impressed me most was Lansu Garden. Together with other volunteers, I introduced Chinese culture to foreigners in Lansu Garden and taught foreigners to speak Chinese. At that moment, when foreigners said hello in Chinese, I deeply felt that although volunteer work was ordinary, it could bring warmth and hope to others, and also made me understand that everything I did was intentional. Righteous. In addition to introducing Chinese culture, I have also participated in environmental protection and public welfare activities. We have organized many community environmental cleaning operations, shuttled through the streets and alleys, picked up garbage, cleaned up sanitary blind spots, and publicized environmental protection knowledge to residents. Seeing that the community environment is becoming clean and tidy day by day, and the residents' awareness of environmental protection is gradually increasing, I am sincerely proud. I believe that as long as everyone can take active action and start from the little things around us, our home will definitely become better. I am well aware that I still have many shortcomings, but I will continue to learn and strive to improve myself, and serve others with fuller enthusiasm and professional knowledge. I look forward to working with more like-minded people to contribute to the progress and development of society and make the world full of love and warmth!"

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Yicheng Zhang.
