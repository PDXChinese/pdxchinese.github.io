# Samantha Ngan - Silver Award

**School: Hosford Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 88**  

"My name is Samantha Ngan,I’m 13 in 8th grade currently and I decided to do these volunteering jobs to be educated and to educate myself and people around me.I heard about these volunteering jobs from a friend and her mom and from then I’ve been doing volunteering for about 2 years. From those two years it had given joy to me having to do this with friends and getting to know people. This is a way I express my gratitude and respect to helpful people also doing similar volunteering on a higher level and I hope this supports the community we have built."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Samantha Ngan.
