# Geng Han - Gold Award

**School: Catlin Gabel School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 261**  

I’m a senior at Catlin Gabel. For the past 3 years, I’ve been volunteering as a teaching assistant at CCBA Chinese Language School and as a food service member at Clark Transition Centers with OCC. At the school, my job mainly revolves around getting younger students interested in learning Chinese, ensuring student health & safety, as well as classroom supervision. As of late, I’ve been more focused on helping create the monthly CCBA newsletter as a content designer, improving its accessibility and visual layout. Each month at Clark Transition Centers, I cook, deliver, and serve freshly cooked food to those in need, usually a couple dozen per shift. It’s been my utmost privilege to have been able to serve others, and I hope to continue doing so in the future.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Geng Han.
