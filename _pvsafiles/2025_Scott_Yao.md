# Scott Yao - Gold Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 103**  

Scott is a sophomore at Lincoln High School. He has always had a passion for learning about the world, including its diverse cultures and amazing geological features. In middle school, he developed a passion for learning languages after being exposed to the beautiful French language and its traditions. It was very different from English and Mandarin, his first and second languages. His newfound love for languages led him to learn another language, Spanish, in high school. In addition to exploring the world, Scott has always been passionate about medicine. He enjoys science and loves helping others in meaningful ways. Consequently, he volunteers as a guide at OHSU, where he helps patients and visitors navigate the labyrinthine hospital campus. On several occasions, Scott also utilized his language skills to effectively communicate with visitors and patients who speak little English. Furthermore, as the son of Chinese immigrants, Scott is passionate about promoting Chinese culture and the language, so he volunteers at the Portland Lan Su Chinese Garden, where he chats with visitors who want to learn Mandarin or more about Chinese culture. Through volunteering, he hopes to create a lasting impact on people's lives, making the world a more multicultural and positive place.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Scott Yao.
