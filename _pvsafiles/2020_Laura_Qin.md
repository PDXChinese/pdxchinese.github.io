# Laura Qin - Bronze Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 103**  

Growing up in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon, Laura was often sheltered from the adversity of reality. She spent her childhood primarily concerned with her academic and social well-being. However, Laura only fully recognized the extent of her privilege when she spent a couple weeks in the rural fringes of China, exposed to an alternate spectrum of struggles - grim struggles. On this trip, she realized the vast public did not have access to government services, specifically healthcare. Moving forward, she started thinking of ways to give back to the less fortunate of her local community. Laura has participated in many volunteer activities throughout her high school career, directing the majority of her volunteering pursuits towards her interest in medicine. In the past year, she obtained a volunteer position at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center in order to further her knowledge about the medical field and directly help others. During her volunteering shifts, she had the opportunity to interact with patients and explore the hospital system. She also participated in a student-led mentor organization called Youth-Link, where she virtually taught middle school students with her peers. Alongside volunteering, Laura is Co-Captain of the Westview Dance Team. She practices approximately 15-20 hours every week, and dance has both physically and mentally challenged her. On the team, she has developed many valuable qualities like perseverance, respect, and humility. Laura’s passions have helped mold her character, benefiting both her and her community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Laura Qin.
