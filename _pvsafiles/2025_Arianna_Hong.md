# Arianna Hong - Gold Award

**School: Beaverton Academy of Science and Engineering**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 121.5**  

"My name is Arianna Hong, and volunteering has given me many opportunities to support my community through responsibility, organization, and teamwork. Although I enjoy performing, I discovered that I am especially helpful in the behind-the-scenes work that keeps our activities running smoothly. Throughout the year, I helped manage digital media for the OCC Diabolo Team—downloading photos, standardized information, and organizing files into Google Drive. This work required accuracy and patience, and I enjoyed knowing that my efforts helped our team stay organized and prepared for events. I also assisted with designing event flyers and editing videos for activities like the Winter Drive. These tasks taught me how important consistency and quiet effort can be.

I also volunteered at many cultural and community events, performing Diabolo and participating in cultural outreach. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, I dressed as Chang’e, the moon goddess, and introduced Chinese traditions to visitors. I enjoyed seeing families learn something new through our interactions.

Volunteering has helped me understand what it means to take responsibility, to work carefully, and to support a team in ways that are not always visible. I hope to continue growing through service and contributing wherever I am needed."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Arianna Hong.
