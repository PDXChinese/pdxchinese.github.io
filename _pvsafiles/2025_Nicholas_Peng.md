# Nicholas Peng - Gold Award

"I’ve been a swimmer my whole life, and throughout recent years I have been putting those skills to use. I wanted to use my swimming skills to help underprivileged people with disabilities learn how to swim. One of my favorite activities when it comes to helping people with disabilities is coaching. I have been coaching at Special Olympics Oregon for over two years now, and I enjoy it a lot. Watching the swimmers learn and grow while also enjoying the sport is what drives me to continue coaching. As a result of this passion, I was tempted to volunteer at Mount Hood Kiwanis Camp for the summer of 2025. A school service project had requested that I complete 65 hours of service, but I wanted to go above that limit, so I volunteered for over 100 hours. Watching all the other volunteers come to Kiwanis camp for a week-long overnight camp with people with disabilities, made my summer much better. In this camp I went through a typical summer camp schedule with campers with disabilities, except the activities were adjusted to accommodate their needs. Beyond this camp, I also reflected on my experiences with a
marginalized population, and I reflected on how I continue to contribute towards boosting this community. Each hour I spent helping people with disabilities reminded me of the importance of being compassionate and accepting. Through both of my experiences serving people with
disabilities, I have grown into someone that is committed to dedicating time and energy to help this underserved community."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Nicholas Peng.
