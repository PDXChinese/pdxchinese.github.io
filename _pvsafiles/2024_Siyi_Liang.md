**School: Sherwood High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**

Siyi is a sophomore at Sherwood High School and participates in multiple volunteer programs and activities. She loves cars (especially the Koenigsegg Jesko), science, writing, pole vaulting(although she's not the best at it but we're getting there), and art. As an active key club member at her school, she helped with community gatherings, food banks, and more. Additionally, she is part of the Jade Dance, a Chinese cultural dance team that performs all around Oregon from schools to festivals to promote cultural awareness and celebrate Chinese heritage. 

Siyi helps her community improve in multiple ways; one of which is tutoring. She started tutoring classmates at school. Later on, creating the nonprofit Bloom Youth Tutoring and tutored five students in different subjects. BloomYTC connects children seeking tutoring to high school students who can volunteer to help for volunteer hours. She also volunteers at a winter camp as an assistant helping young children; furthermore, she interned at a German international school for a summer camp about science and Chinese for a month.

From volunteering at camps during the summer and winter to designing in different media, Siyi fulfills her love for art through multiple creative outlets. She created the 2024 Oregon Lunar New Year Gala performance brochure as well as advertisement posters for interest classes, lectures, and more. Beyond that, she is also the vice president of SAGE, her school's girlsï¿½ engineering club. Her favorite part of being in it is creating cool car T-shirts which she shows off to her friends using t-shirt vinyl and designing through Rhino 3D.

Besides SAGE, Siyi is also a part of multiple different clubs in her school, like Green Club, which helps pick up trash around the school; and Outdoor School Club, which she intends on being a counselor for in the spring. She also participates in DECA, aiming for an officer position next year, and lastly, a girls' weightlifting club, where she plans to improve her fitness. Siyi's commitment and leadership hope to connect cultures, help support students academically, and make her community a better place.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Siyi Liang.
