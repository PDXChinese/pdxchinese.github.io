# Katie Jin - Gold Award

**School: Catlin Gabel**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 261**  

This last year, Katie has dedicated time to various service activities. A notable activity from this last year was her execution of a food service project that OCC is currently partnered with Multnomah County on. In this project, she has gotten the opportunity to lead the Youth Advisory Council in preparing nutritious lunches for those currently experiencing homelessness. Her favorite part is working with the elementary schoolers to pack meals and write cards of encouragement for this receiving the lunches. In the last year, they have made over 400 meals and care packages, an achievement that she is very proud of. 
Besides for that, she has also been serving on the Mayors Youth Advisory Board, advising the mayor and city council on how to make Beaverton a youth conscious city. This work has taught her more about advocacy and civics, and she is exited to continue that work in the future. Beyond volunteering, Katie loves to spend time with her friends, running, and finding new food places in Portland.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Katie Jin.
