# Cynthia Zhao - Gold Award

**School: Jesuit High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 211**  

My name is Cindy Zhao. At Jesuit, we have a saying that's more than just words on a wall: we're called to be "people for others." For me, that idea has become the foundation for how I want to live my life. As a junior at Jesuit High School, my commitment to being a "person for others" extends beyond the classroom and into the heart of our community. Through my involvement with the Oregon Chinese Coalition (OCC), I have dedicated over 200 hours to service, focusing on cultural enrichment and youth mentorship. My primary role has been as a dedicated member and leader of the OCC Youth Dance Team, where I contributed 101 hours to preserving and sharing Chinese cultural traditions.

Living with a bleeding disorder has given me a unique empathy for those facing health challenges, which led me to volunteer 105 hours with the Pacific Northwest Bleeding Disorders organization. There, I connected with and supported children during their time at our annual Camp Tapawingo as a counselor-in-training. This perspective also brought me to the Hurtado Center, where I dedicated my time to tutoring immigrants, helping them overcome the language barriers that stand between them and this society.

These experiences, from offering support in a community I know personally to welcoming new members into our broader community, have solidified my passion for service.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Cynthia Zhao.
