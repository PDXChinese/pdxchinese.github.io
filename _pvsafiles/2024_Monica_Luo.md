# Monica Luo - Gold Award

**School: ISB**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 115**  

My name is Monica Luo, a student from the International School of Beaverton. Over the past year, Ive had the opportunity to engage in many meaningful activities outside of school, including extracurriculars like rhythmic gymnastics and debate, as well as volunteering in various areas.

One of the most meaningful things I accomplished this year was starting guitar classes for students in the Oregon Chinese Coalition. It was a particularly fulfilling experience because I got to watch the kids I taught weekly learn the basics of guitar and music. Teaching these lessons has truly been one of the highlights of the year, as I learned so much alongside the students I worked with. Being able to teach and start these classes really showed me how music can touch peoples lives.

Additionally, I gained valuable experiences from judging VEX IQ robotics competitions and participating in cultural exchanges. Judging these competitions was an especially interesting volunteering opportunity because I personally participated in VEX IQ and currently compete in VEX VRC. It was fascinating to see the ideas and concepts coming from these students. Through cultural exchanges, I shared elements of my heritage and learned about the history of others in both the U.S. and China. These experiences have given me a deeper understanding and appreciation for different cultures.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Monica Luo.
