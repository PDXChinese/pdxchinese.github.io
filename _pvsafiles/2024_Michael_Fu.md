Michael is a junior at Sunset High School. During his elementary and middle school years he has seen older kids helping the community through many kinds of volunteer activities. Inspired by them and committed to giving back to the community, Michael started volunteering in 8th grade. In the past year, he continued to routinely volunteer at his local library, helping with circulation. Additionally, he joined the Teen Library Council to help shape and enhance library programs and services. Within the library environment, he has learned valuable experience by working to help other people. Michael also continued to help teach younger children math and grade their quizzes and homework at an afterschool where he started his own math learning and was helped by older kids. Furthermore, Michael has been volunteering at outreaches for his robotics team by inviting industry professionals to present to students, hosting tours at various STEM-related companies, demonstrating his teams robot, and more. From these experiences, Michael has made it his mission not only to contribute to the community, but also to inspire younger kids to help them and make their world a better place.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Michael Fu.
