# Bryan Zhang - Gold Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 507**  

Bryan is a sophomore at Westview High School and a dedicated volunteer with a passion for helping his community wherever he’s needed. He plays a key role in the Oregon Chinese Coalition’s Emergency Preparedness project, leading the development of systems and tools that keep the community safer during crises. He created the project website and mobile apps, as well as an inventory system to help the team track supplies. For Bryan, leading this project is not just about tech, it’s about making sure the community has the resources to stay safe.

In addition to his work on the Emergency Preparedness program, Bryan volunteers at a wide range of OCC events. He helps set up stage and sound equipment, assists with event operations, and steps in wherever help is needed. He also works directly with community members and seniors, from home improvement to maintenance and beyond.

Thanks to the Oregon Chinese Coalition, Bryan has been able to volunteer beyond OCC. At the Clark Center Shelter, he regularly prepares and serves meals to the homeless in Portland. Through these experiences, he strengthens his belief and caring through action and supporting people with compassion.

Across the board, Bryan is committed to supporting others and making a positive impact in his community, one project, event, or person at a time.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Bryan Zhang.
