Zoey, a junior at Westview High School, is the founder of Puddletown Chess, a nonprofit organization that has contributed to Oregons chess community. As an experienced chess player with both national and international recognition, Zoey works to support scholastic players across the state, helping them improve their skills. Under her guidance, Puddletown Chess offers a variety of programs, including weekly training for players of different levels, a weekly online Lichess arena, monthly over-the-board tournaments, and free educational webinars. This year, Puddletown Chess has donated over $20,000 to support local chess initiatives. Zoey is committed to making chess more inclusive, ensuring that all Puddletown tournaments are free for girls, low-income players, and those from rural areas, so that chess remains accessible to a wide range of participants.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Zoey Tang.
