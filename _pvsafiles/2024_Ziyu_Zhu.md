She currently leads a club in her high school and is an administrator in an active robotics server with over 100 members. She’s an officer in the Forest Height’s HOA Youth Leadership Committee, where they have meetings to plan events to bring the community together. She’s also the vice president of Multnomah County’s Youth Advisory Board; comprised of dedicated individuals determined to bring safety into Multnomah County, the YAB hosts meetings 2-3 times a month to discuss how to decrease violence in neighborhoods through collaboration. She’s looking forward to starting a Science National Honors Society in her high school to encourage STEM throughout the student body and promote academic excellence.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ziyu Zhu.
