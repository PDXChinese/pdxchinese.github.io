# Oliver Strayer - Gold Award

**School: Jesuit High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 107.09**  

I am Oliver Strayer, a sophomore at Jesuit High School in Oregon. I am competing in ISEF
this year as well as training intensely to compete in Badminton. I have also worked with
OHSU in the past for training. I am beginning to be a part of HOSA and non-profit
organizations. I enjoy talking with others and anything that has to do with community. I love
learning about how things work and how different people think differently. I am always
looking for opportunities to show my growth.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Oliver Strayer.
