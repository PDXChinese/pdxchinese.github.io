# Alexis Zou - Gold Award

**School: Lake Oswego High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 270.5**  

Hi, my name is Alexis Zou, and I'm a junior at Lake Oswego High School. I am dedicated to bringing my community together through my music and volunteer work. I'm one of the co-leaders of my school's Asian American Student Union, and we organize city-wide festivals like the Asian Cultural Festival and the Diwali Festival with LO for Love. I also perform regularly at various local senior homes and host speaker panels as a co-leader of the Women In STEM (WiSTEM) club.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Alexis Zou.
