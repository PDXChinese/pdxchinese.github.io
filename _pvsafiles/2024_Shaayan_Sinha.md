Shaayan is a sophomore at Glencoe High School committed to tackling Youth Substance Usage in High Schools. Working alongside a Senator, he introduced a bill to the Oregon Legislature seeking the installation of vape detectors in Oregon public high school bathrooms in order to provide help to overcome student's addiction. He is currently garnering support for this bill.  
He currently serves as the ambassador on his city's youth council, where he is working amongst his peers to increase youth engagement in local government. This past summer, he attained over 120+ volunteer hours at OHSU, where he guided visitors, cleaned and transported wheelchairs, and refilled masks, sanitizers, etc. 
In his spare time, he enjoys mathematics, chess, working out, and finding ways to improve his community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Shaayan Sinha.
