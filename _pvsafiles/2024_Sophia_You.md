# Sophia You - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 250**  

Sophia is a senior at Sunset High School. If shes not at school or on an emergency Target grocery run, you can usually find her at Cedar Mill Community Library - either hunting for her next read, cramming for her next test, helping the circulation staff, or dropping off supplies for a library event. In her free time, Sophia loves drawing, painting, reading, and binging Netflix shows.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Sophia You.
