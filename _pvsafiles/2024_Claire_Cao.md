# Claire Cao - Gold Award

**Hours: 450**  

Claire is 18 years old and a senior at Jesuit High School. She founded the Jade Dance Team as a freshman, and this year, the team has reached new milestones, performing at over 40 cultural events and expanding its role as a platform for celebrating Chinese culture. With over 20 members from various schools, Claire leads the team by organizing performances, teaching dances, and fostering connections within the community. Through the Jade Dance Team, Claire continues to build community and celebrate Chinese culture through the art of dance.
Beyond her work with the Jade Dance Team, Claire is deeply committed to serving the unhoused community. Since summer 2023, she has been volunteering at Blanchet House, a food shelter in Chinatown providing free meals. As a student ambassador, Claire has served meals, organized donation drives, and helped with community outreach. She also participates in volunteer efforts through OCC, including their winter drive and monthly cooking and serving meals for the unhoused. These experiences have given her a deeper understanding of the challenges facing vulnerable populations and a passion for creating solutions.
As part of her role as a Blanchet House student ambassador, Claire launched a mobile app to connect unhoused individuals to critical resources such as shelters, food services, and legal support. Combining her dedication to service with a drive for innovation, Claire continues to focus on building tangible solutions that make a meaningful impact in her community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Claire Cao.
