# Bella Lin - Gold Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 112**  

Bella is a ninth grader at Westview High School who is passionate about serving her community and inspiring others through STEM. As a dedicated member of her robotics team, she promotes the idea that STEM is a pathway to opportunity and success. She believes STEM not only strengthens academic achievement but also builds strategic thinking, leadership, and time management skills. Through outreach programs, she teaches younger students about STEM, sparking curiosity and confidence in the next generation. Her dedication reflects a vision of creating a more inclusive future where every child can dream big and discover meaningful opportunities.

When she isn’t volunteering at robotics events or promoting STEM, Bella enjoys spending time in the library, playing clarinet in her school band, and exploring her creative side through drawing. She also stays active with basketball, swimming on her splash team, and biking.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Bella Lin.
