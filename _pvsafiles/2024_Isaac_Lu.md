# Isaac Lu - Bronze Award

**School: Lake Oswego High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 55**  

Hi, my name is Isaac and Im a Freshman at Lake Oswego High School, I like playing tennis
and assembling model kits. This year Ive started volunteering at a homeless shelter in Portland
by cooking and serving food. Ive also volunteered at the Oregon Zoo at a health convention run
by the OCC. I find volunteering to be enjoyable because you can learn from your experiences
and even gain some life skills.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Isaac Lu.
