**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 28**  

"Hi, my name is Helen Guo. I’m 9 years old, and now a fourth-grade student at Springville Elementary School. I am from China, and I love being involved in my community.

I enjoy volunteering, especially in activities that promote Chinese culture. I like sharing traditions and helping people learn more about our culture. I also enjoy helping others and caring for animals whenever I can.

Through volunteering, I hope to bring kindness to my community and make a positive difference."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Helen Guo.
