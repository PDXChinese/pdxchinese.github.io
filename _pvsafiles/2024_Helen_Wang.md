Helen Wang, a senior at Sunset High School, serves as the captain and outreach lead of the FTC robotics team Overcharged. She founded "Sparks of STEM," an initiative aimed at providing STEM education and opportunities to underrepresented students across Oregon. In collaboration with the Portland Metro STEM Hub, Helen developed a unique hands-on curriculum and brought the program to over 800 students across 20 schools. Additionally, she raised $6,000 in funding to support STEM activities and to help establish robotics teams. In the future, Helen plans to expand the Sparks of STEM initiative by establishing additional hubs throughout Oregon to empower more students with STEM knowledge.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Helen Wang.
