Winston has been a dedicated member of the OCC Diabolo Team over the past year, volunteering his time and energy to promote Chinese culture through performance and practice. He loves contributing to the community, and his commitment shows through the countless hours he spends mastering the art of diabolo, rehearsing with his team, and participating in cultural demonstrations. Winston has performed in big cultural events in the city of Portland, such as the Chinese Festival at Pioneer Square in downtown and the Return of Dragon in Chinatown. Winston’s passion, perseverance, and enthusiasm help strengthen cultural appreciation within the community while inspiring others to explore and celebrate traditional Chinese arts.

In addition to his work with the OCC Diabolo Team, Winston also volunteers at Chinese Conversation Table, where he helps create an engaging and welcoming environment for learners of all ages interested in Chinese language and culture. Whether assisting with activities, guiding conversations, or supporting cultural workshops, Winston brings enthusiasm and patience to every session. His efforts not only help participants improve their language skills but also deepen their understanding of Chinese traditions. Through his involvement, Winston continues to demonstrate his love for contributing to the community and sharing the richness of Chinese culture with others."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Winston Larrow.
