# Alena Li - Gold Award

**School: Crescent Valley High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 100**  

"Hi! My name is Alena Li and I am a Sophomore at Crescent Valley High School. I have many hobbies, the most prominent ones being soccer and robotics. Last year, I was unable to play soccer due to a knee injury, so I joined robotics. It quickly became one of my favorite hobbies and I made many friends on the team. Last year, I was also elected as fabrication captain of the rookie team, and this year, I was elected as the fabrication captain of the experienced team. I was able to play varsity soccer this season and received an all conference second team award. I played the saxophone for 4 years and played on the marching band as well. In my free time I also enjoy reading, going on runs, watching movies, listening to music, and spending time with my cat."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Alena Li.
