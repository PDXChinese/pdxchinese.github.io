# Carol Wang - Gold Award

**School: Jesuit High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 152**  

My name is Carol Wang, and I’m currently a junior at Jesuit High School. I’m a passionate and driven individual who enjoys balancing academics, extracurricular activities, and giving back to my community. One of my favorite hobbies is art—it allows me to express my creativity and unwind. I also love volunteering, which has become a meaningful part of my life. Over the past year, I’ve been fortunate to expand my involvement in community service, especially through my work with the Lake Oswego Lions Club. Volunteering has been such a rewarding experience because it gives me the opportunity to help others, make an impact, and connect with like-minded people who share the same desire to improve the world around us. Outside of volunteering and school, I am a proud member of the OCC Jade Dance Team, which I joined last year. It’s been an incredible journey learning and performing Chinese cultural dances while bonding with my teammates. Being part of this team has allowed me to celebrate my cultural heritage and share it with others in a fun and creative way.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Carol Wang.
