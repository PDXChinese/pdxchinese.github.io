# Leo Zhao - Gold Award

**School: Camas High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 168**  

Leo is a 9th grader from Camas High School. During the 2021-2022 school year and the summer of 2022, he hosted online classes teaching students about the programming language Java. Along with teaching the students the concepts being tested on the AP Computer Science exam, knowing how to code in Java can be a very useful real-world skill as it is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, with countless applications in many fields.

Teaching and educating other people about what Leo is interested in has been something he has wanted to do for a long time and he was inspired to share his
knowledge with those around him. In addition to tasks such as grading homework and hosting office hours on the weekend, many of the resources used in the class have been curated and edited by him. Leo understands that some of the material may be a little complex to understand, but he hopes that all the students he has worked with have learned something that could help them achieve their goals and complete their own projects in the future.

Throughout Leo's experience working with his students, he has come to value the importance of good communication skills in both text and voice, and he hopes that he will continue to improve his skills as he continues to teach and grow as a person. He is proud to have been able to serve and impact his community in a positive way, and is very thankful to everyone who has helped him along this journey.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Leo Zhao.
