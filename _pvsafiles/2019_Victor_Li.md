# Victor Zelin Li - Gold Award

**School: Jesuit High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 113**  

Victor is a freshman in Jesuit High School. Interested in meeting people and initiating conversations, he has a natural talent in understanding, comforting and helping others. Participating in Beaverton Young Entrepreneurs Academy and TYE Young Entrepreneurs helped him develop his social, communication and leadership skills. Inspired by the leaders and members of the Oregon Chinese Coalition and their monumental effort in serving the community, he became more enthusiastic about helping others. He volunteered for the Oregon Food Bank, Camp Meadowood Springs (a special camp supported by Oregon Elks Lodge for kids with communication challenges), Clay Street Table (where free brunch is served to the elderly people), Shriners Hospitals for Children during camps, Walk for Love fundraising event, and the Abate Toy Drive. Through volunteering work, he met people with different ethnic, culture and socioeconomic backgrounds. He felt deeply for those in need, acted earnestly to help, and became more and more passionate about serving the community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Victor Li.
