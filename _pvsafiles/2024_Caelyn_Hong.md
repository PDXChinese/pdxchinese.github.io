# Caelyn Hong - Silver Award

**School: Hope Chinese Charter School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10 years old)**  
**Hours: 50**  

Hi! I am in sixth grade at Hope Chinese Charter School. Throughout this year, I have done a lot of volunteer work. My experiences have helped me understand the purpose of volunteering and why its so important, which has motivated me to continue giving back. Organizations like the Dragonfly Yoyo Team and Oregon Food Bank have given me the opportunity to help others and serve as a volunteer. Im truly grateful for these opportunities and for the joy that comes with helping others. Volunteering has shown me the happiness of making a difference and has inspired me to encourage others to do the same.
In my free time, I enjoy volunteering in different ways. For example, I helped spruce up the library, repackaged food at the Oregon Food Bank for those in need, and performed with the Chinese yoyo. Volunteering brings me so much joy, and I am excited to continue sharing Chinese culture with others who appreciate it.
Volunteer service has taught me a lot and helped me grow. And my goal for next year is to be more caring, patient, and dedicated to doing my best as a volunteer. In the future I will keep doing volunteer work. Thank you!

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Caelyn Hong.
