# Ria Ganesh - Silver Award

**School: Bonny Slope Elementary School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 58**  

"My name is Ria and I'm 8 years old. I'm in 3rd grade.

I like to help people by singing and dancing. I volunteered with OCC at different shows. I danced at an NBA pregame show, and I sang at the Clark Center shelter for Lunar New Year. I also sang in "We are family" and "You Raise Me Up." It was really fun!

I like performing because it makes people smile and happy. When I see people enjoying our show, it makes me feel good inside. I also like practicing with my friends - we help each other learn the songs and dances.

I love music a lot. I play piano and flute. I also like gymnastics and making art and crafts. My favorite thing is when I can help people feel better.

I want to keep volunteering by singing and dancing. Maybe I can also play my flute or piano for people someday. I think music makes everyone happy!"

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Ria Ganesh.
