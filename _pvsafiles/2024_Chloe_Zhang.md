# Chloe Zhang - Gold Award

**School: Sherwood High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 105.17**  

Chloe Zhang is a freshman at Sherwood High School, where she has already started to
make a positive impact on her community through various activities and passions. Since joining
her local BSA troop, she has taken part in numerous service projects, each of which has
deepened her appreciation for giving back and helping others. Some of her most memorable
projects include building a new playhouse for a local playground, a task that involved both
creativity and teamwork, and taking on environmental projects like removing invasive plant
species to help restore the local ecosystem. Through these experiences, Chloe has discovered
a true passion for volunteering, which she has since combined with her other personal interests.
Chloe spends many of her weekends volunteering with the Cat Adoption Team, where
she helps care for cats in need of loving homes. She is also dedicated to bringing joy to the
residents at a nearby nursing home, where she volunteers regularly. Her talents as a violinist
allow her to share beautiful music with the residents and lift their spirits. In her free time, Chloe
has a range of hobbies that keep her engaged. She enjoys reading, discovering new worlds and
perspectives with each story, and playing chess, where she continually hones her strategic
thinking. And, of course, she loves spending time with her neighbor's friendly cat, giving it plenty
of pets whenever she has the chance.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Chloe Zhang.
