# Qinglu Xu - Gold Award

**School: Lake Oswego High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 274**  

Hi! I'm Qinglu Xu and I'm currently a junior at Lake Oswego High School! I strive to channel my love for my culture and my passions into community service work. I have volunteered at a range of different organizations like Lions Club, OCC, Legacy, etc. 
I am a co-founder of the VisionEnvoy Branch of the Lake Oswego Lions Club --- a nonprofit organization that would benefit those who need but don’t have access to eye services --- in 7th grade. I wear my glasses daily, and I know how important it is to have good eye services and care.  In these past years, we have come so far in our journey, got to meet so many new friends, and provided service to those in our community. We have now become a branch of the Lake Oswego Lions Club, bringing new ideas and our own goals into the community. This past summer, I completed one of the biggest projects that I have taken on, which was to create an official website for VisionEnvoy. Through my efforts to better the community, I have developed valuable leadership skills as well as how to efficiently work with others. Continuing with the theme of service, I am passionate about pursuing a career in the field of healthcare and am looking forward to everything the field has to offer in the future! In school, I enjoy partaking in courses like Organic Chemistry and Human Anatomy and Physiology. Outside of school, I enjoy playing piano, painting, playing tennis, and hanging out with friends. These all have come to shape me the way I am today, and I'm excited for what the future has to offer.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Qinglu Xu.
