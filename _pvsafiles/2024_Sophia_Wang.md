# Sophia Wang - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 123**  

Sophia is a junior at Sunset High School. Having been a deeply invested member in many
different communities—the STEM community, the robotics community, the Speech and Debate
community, and the greater Portland community—Sophia is passionate about giving back to
empower future generations. Over the past year, Sophia volunteered extensively at the Transition
Projects shelter. Moreover, she enjoyed teaching a variety of STEM concepts—from simple
machines to capillary action to chemical reactions—to elementary school students at Findley
Elementary. She also volunteered as an official qualifying match and finals match scoring judge
at the Oregon VEX IQ Robotics Challenge State Championships. Furthermore, Sophia has
volunteered at multiple middle school and high school Speech and Debate tournaments as a
judge to help shape the paths of beginners in Speech and Debate.
Currently, in her speech and debate team, Sophia is an event captain for both Public Forum
debate and Radio Commentary, and not only teaches the events to new debaters but also
develops the curriculum and organizes the Canvas pages as resources. Outside of volunteering,
Sophia enjoys running cross country, debating at Speech and Debate tournaments, and painting.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Sophia Wang.
