# Anika Rigby - Gold Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 273**  

Anika is a junior at Lincoln High School. Over the past year, she has committed to a wide range of roles to strengthen her connection to both her school and her city.

After winning the national championship in Constitutional debate, she helped mentor the following year's team, guiding students through the U.S. Constitution. She also teaches citizenship classes to green card holders through Mission: Citizen, preparing them not only for the naturalization exam but for a lifetime of informed civic participation. As the organization's finance director, she helps provide scholarships to alleviate the financial burden the exam may pose. Her dedication to politics extends through her internship with New Voters and at the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, supporting voting rights, democratic participation, and civic duty.   

Anika also promotes health and welfare through her engagement Blood Cancer United and the Red Cross, and teaches about wildlife conservation at the Oregon Zoo. At her school, she helps guide new students through their transition to Lincoln; she hopes everyone there feels they are in a safe, welcoming environment. At Lincoln, she helps welcome new students as a Cardinal Ambassador. She serves as secretary of the National Chinese Honor Society and co-president of the Asian Student Union--both of which foster cultural appreciation and belonging.

With the Oregon Chinese Coalition, Anika dances with Jade Dance Team and founded Lincoln's Pink Valley Dance Team, combining her passion for dance with service to the community through performances and cultural events. She hopes to continue using her diverse skills to contribute meaningfully to her city.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Anika Rigby.
