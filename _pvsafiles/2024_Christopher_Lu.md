# Christopher Lu - Gold Award

I am Chris Lu, a Freshman at Lake Oswego High School in Oregon. I am a member of the Chinese Friendship Association of Portland. I enjoy video games, pc building, playing sports like badminton and water polo and watching anime. I also like to volunteer and serve the community, as well as making new friends.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Christopher Lu.
