# Qinyun (Amy) Zhu - Gold Award

**School: Valley Catholic High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 121**  

"Hi, my name is Amy and I am a junior at Valley Catholic High School! Throughout the past few years, I have been volunteering at OCC-sponsored events, such as helping with the stands at Lansu Garden, assisting with activities during the mid-autumn festival, volunteering at cultural dances/parades, and so on. I learned of the Transition Projects through OCC as well where we can assist people transitioning into permanent homes. Most recently, I have started volunteering at Youthline, a free, peer to peer mental health crisis line where youth (aged 10-24) can talk to people of their age through texts, chats, and calls. To prepare for this work, I completed a 50-hour training over the summer along with many additional training sessions and shadow shifts. Since then, I have been volunteering at lines for life frequently. It is something I’m very passionate about, so I plan on putting more work into Youthline in the future too. From all these volunteering opportunities, I’ve gotten to learn from many friendly peers and supervisors, and it is an honor to be able to work on personal growth and give back to my community in this way :)"

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Qinyun Zhu.
