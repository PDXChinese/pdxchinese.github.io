# David Dahui Sha - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 113**  

David came to the United States as a third grader in 2012. In 2013, David started to volunteer at the Oregon Food Bank, Boy Scout, school cares club and local community events.  When seeing smiles being put on the faces of those who were in difficult situations, David realized that there are a lot of people who need help, and that spreading love and hope to those who need it can be very meaningful. David started volunteering more regularly, and kept up the good work day after day, and year after year. On top of this, he inspired and influenced those around him. More people like his friends and classmates got involved to volunteer and help people together.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to David Sha.
