# Jessie Pan - Gold Award

**School: Lake Oswego High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 118.5**  

My name is Jessie, and I am currently a freshman at Lake Oswego High School. I am currently 14. For me, my main goal was to help out others in my community & make a difference in this world.

During my fifth grade year, I learned how to code Java. Soon after, I followed my mentors footsteps and started to also teach new students and relay my information over to them. I have been currently teaching for a year and a half - one of my biggest accomplishments is having students understand what Im teaching and apply their knowledge to their future classes.

I am also a member of the VisionEnvoy branch of the Lake Oswego Lions Club. I love helping out with the clubs various events, ranging from cooking breakfast & lunch to wearing traditional Chinese clothing & spreading the word about ancient Chinese culture/traditions. I want to raise awareness about our club, and continue to help out the community in many different way

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jessie Pan.
