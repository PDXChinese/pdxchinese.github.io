# Jasper Xu - Bronze Award

**School: Bridlemile Elementary School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10)**  
**Hours: 37**  

"My name is Jasper Xu. I'm 10 years old and in the 5th grade at Bridlemile Elementary School. This year I volunteered 37 hours. One time I volunteered was during the OCC Annual Winter drive. During the winter drive we collected a significantly large amount of food, coats, and many other types of clothing, which we donated to the Transition Project. This year I also helped make lots of meals for people in need. I made lots of chicken stir fry and drumsticks and prepared grapes and sweet treats. Finally I helped the Bing in the New Year Celebration by making lots of crafts and hosting games. This was particularly fun because of the fact that I was able to watch all these people have fun with the things that I made.

All in all I am very grateful for all the learning experiences I endorsed. I'm grateful to have helped, assisted and served my community.""

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Jasper Xu.
