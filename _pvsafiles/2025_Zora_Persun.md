Zora is a junior at Jesuit High School. This is her third year on the Jesuit FRC Robotics team where she currently serves as the Business Lead. With her robotics team, she mentors younger students with their robotics programs and coordinates STEM events. She is also on the editorial team of her school’s literary-arts magazine where she curates art, photography, and writing.
