# Caelyn Hong - Gold Award

**School: Lake Oswego Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 110**  

"My name is Caelyn Hong, and I’m a 13-year-old student at Lake Oswego Middle School. Volunteering has become a meaningful part of my life because it helps me connect with others and understand my culture better.

At Hope Chinese Charter School, I spent my summers helping teachers, supporting younger students, and assisting with activities for the sports club. I helped organize games, set up materials, and made sure everyone felt included and encouraged because I’ve learned Chinese for many years, I’ve also been able to help kids learn basic Chinese and understand more about the culture. Sharing what I’ve learned has made me proud of my heritage and I appreciate being able to share it with younger students. Doing this taught me how to be patient, pay attention to others’ needs, and stay reliable, especially when working with kids who needed extra help.

Outside of school, I volunteer with the Dragonfly Diabolo Team, where I practice regularly and perform at community events. Being part of this team lets me share Chinese culture, inspire younger kids, and work toward something meaningful with others. I also perform guzheng at some community events, which gives me another way to share Chinese culture and connect with audiences. Performing on stage has helped build my confidence, and practicing with my team has taught me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance.

These experiences helped me grow in ways I didn’t expect. Working with younger children taught me how to communicate more clearly and stay calm when things get busy. I learned how to take initiative, solve problems quickly, and adjust when plans changed. Volunteering also showed me that even small actions—like explaining instructions or cheering someone on—can make a big difference. Moments like these helped me become more confident, thoughtful, and aware of the people around me. Volunteering continues to shape how I grow and learn, and I hope to keep finding new ways to support my community and challenge myself."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Caelyn Hong.
