Zong is an eighth grader currently at Catlin Gabel Middle School and has dedicated their time and skills to serving the community through volunteer work at the Clark Center Shelter. As part of their ongoing commitment to giving back, they have taken the initiative to prepare and serve Chinese cuisine to shelter residents, offering culturally diverse meals and a sense of care and connection.

Their volunteer efforts have become an important part of the shelter's food program, providing a unique culinary experience that helps uplift and support individuals facing challenging circumstances.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Zong Qu.
