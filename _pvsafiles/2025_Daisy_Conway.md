# Daisy Conway - Gold Award

**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 178**  

Daisy Conway is an 11th grade student at Mountain View High School who loves to participate in volunteering events and interact with the community. As the NHS president at her school, Daisy loves connecting and reaching out to local organizations to find new volunteering opportunities. Specifically, she loves volunteering at the elementary schools in her district, where she interacts with younger students and supports their learning environments.

During the last year, Daisy has focused her efforts on ShelterBridge, a nonprofit organization that focuses on compiling resources for the homeless. As the Washington State Lead, Daisy connects with youth leaders and legislators to further the effect of ShelterBridge, hoping to make a meaningful impact regarding the issue of homelessness.  Daisy is also one of the student representatives of her school district, representing around 22,000 students with her fellow representative. She regularly presents reports to the board, in addition to giving a panel at the annual WSSDA conference to communicate why more school districts should implement student representatives within their board.

In her spare time, Daisy enjoys figure skating, playing the violin, going on hikes, and hanging out with her friends and two cats BB and Bon Bon. 

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Daisy Conway.
