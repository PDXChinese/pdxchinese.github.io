# Bella Lin - Bronze Award

**School: Meadow Park Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 55**  

Bella is an 8th grader at Meadow Park Middle School who enjoys supporting her community and encouraging others around her to pursue STEM. At her middle school, Bella noticed that many students often missed meals due to poverty. This led her to volunteer at food banks, where she harvested crops that were later donated to families. Bella also enjoys spreading the word about STEM through her robotics team, as she believes that STEM can help children achieve better academic success and help them better understand the world. She also thinks it can help children develop strategic thinking skills, better leadership, and good time management. She often teaches younger children about STEM through the outreaches that the robotics team holds.
When she isnt volunteering at local food banks or promoting STEM in the community, you can find Bella in a library, playing her saxophone or clarinet in her school band. She also enjoys drawing, playing basketball, swimming in a splash team, and biking.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Bella Lin.
