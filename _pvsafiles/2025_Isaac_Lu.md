# Isaac Lu - Gold Award

**School: Catlin Gabel School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 103**  

'My name is Isaac, and I’m a Sophomore at Catlin Gabel. I like playing tennis and building model kits. I’ve been volunteering at a homeless shelter in Portland by cooking and serving food. I have also volunteered at the Oregon Zoo at a health convention run by the OCC. I find volunteering to be enjoyable because you can learn from your experiences and even gain some life skills.'

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Isaac Lu.
