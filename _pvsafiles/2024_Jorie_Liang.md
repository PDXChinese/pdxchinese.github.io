**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 350.75**  

My name is Jorie Liang and I am a Junior at Catlin Gabel. This year, I participated and held leadership roles in numerous volunteer organizations. My volunteering is centered around 2 themes: promoting cultural exchange and humanitarian services. I am the vice president of the VisionEnvoy Branch of the Lake Oswego Lions club, where we strive to perform services in the areas of environment, cancer, vision, diabetes, and hunger. Additionally, I was a co-leader of a team in the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society's 2023-24 Student Visionary of the Year campaign; My co-leader and I won the title Student Visionary of the Year by raising $42,000+ with our team for the purposes of cancer patient care and research. I promoted cultural exchange through OCC's Jade Dance Team, the Chinese Youth and Women Organization, and the Chinese Friendship Association. Moreover, I had the honor to represent the richness and tradition of Chinese culture at the Multnomah County Fair, KOIN6 tv, New York Fashion Week, and more.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jorie Liang.
