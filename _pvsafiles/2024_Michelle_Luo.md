# Michelle Luo - Gold Award

**School: Sexton Mountain Elementary School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10 years old)**  
**Hours: 81**  

My name is Michelle, and I am a fifth grader at Sexton Mountain Elementary. Outside of school, I enjoy doing activities like rhythmic gymnastics, guitar, VEX IQ Robotics, and ballet. I spent a lot of time volunteering. I helped with cultural exchange and performances, supported robotics competitions, and worked at food banks.
Volunteering has been a great experience for me. It feels good to help out with things I care about and see how it makes a difference. Ive learned how to work better with others, lead a team, and stay organized. These experiences have helped me grow and made me feel proud of what I've done. I'm really thankful for the chance to give back and be part of such fun and meaningful events.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Michell Luo.
