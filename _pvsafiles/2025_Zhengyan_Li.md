# Zhengyan Li - Gold Award

**School: Southridge High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 103**  

"My name is Zhengyan Li,and I am 15 years old. At present, I am a high school student. My usual hobbies are mainly playing basketball and cycling. I like to challenge myself in sports, and I also enjoy the sense of accomplishment brought by teamwork.

In the past year, I have participated in a number of community volunteer activities, including clothing donation activities, sidewalk cleaning, festival arrangement, etc. Through these volunteer services, I not only learned how to communicate and cooperate with different people, but also better understood the meaning of responsibility, patience and helping others. I feel proud to be able to contribute my strength in the community.

In the future, I hope to continue to participate in more volunteer activities and make continuous progress in learning and interest. "

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Zhengyan Li.
