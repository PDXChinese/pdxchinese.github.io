# Brianna Hong - Gold Award

Volunteering has allowed me to share my creativity, connect with people, and bring positive energy to my community. I love interacting with others, and many of my volunteer experiences have involved communication, performance, and cultural exchange. I volunteered at numerous community events where I performed Diabolo, helping introduce audiences to this traditional art form. One of my favorite experiences was volunteering as Chang’e during the Mid-Autumn Festival. I enjoyed greeting visitors, taking photos with children and families, and helping people learn about Chinese culture in a friendly and welcoming way. In addition to performing, I also contributed to our team’s projects by helping sort photos, design promotional materials, and support video editing. I like creative work, and I enjoy helping our projects look lively and engaging—especially during the Winter Drive, where we created flyers and helped promote the donation event. Volunteering has helped me build confidence, express myself, and understand the impact of kindness and community involvement. I look forward to continuing to help others, especially through activities that allow me to connect with people and share meaningful experiences.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Brianna Hong.
