fundraising and recruiting. He also competes in swimming and tennis with his school. He
developed an interest in medicine at an early age, leading him to volunteer at OHSU, providing

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Eli Du.
