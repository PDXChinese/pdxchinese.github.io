# George Yu - Silver Award

**School: Bridlemile Elemetary School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10 years old)**  
**Hours: 63**  

Im George Yu and I am 8 years old. I'm in 3rd grade at Bridlemile Elementary School. Last year I joined the Chinese yoyo. I practice every week. I volunteered at Lan Su Chinese Garden. I helped people make Chinese nian hua and origami. I also taught people to play yoyo. And I also volunteered at the Oregon Zoo. I taught people how to play Chinese yoyo again. The practices are at Hope Chinese Charter School. We had many performances.
Some places are. Waterfront Pioneer Square, Milwauke Community Center, Lakeridge High School, Twality Middle School, PSU Farmers Market, Jenkins Estate, etc. 
I am happy that I am part of this community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to George Yu.
