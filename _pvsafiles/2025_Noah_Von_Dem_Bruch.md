# Noah Von Dem Bruch - Gold Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-25)**  
**Hours: 256**  

"I am currently a senior at Lincoln High School. I have been leading the Lincoln Support and Services club at my school, recruiting students to provide technology support for seniors at local residential homes. While helping the elderly with their various technology problems, I enjoy and get inspired by conversing with them and listening to the rich life stories and values that they wish to share. Although modern technologies have created even bigger generational gaps, I feel gratified to see our services help bridge the gaps through human connections.

I have practiced Chinese Martial Arts (Wushu) ever since I was young. Wushu has taught me the importance of respect, perseverance, confidence, and compassion. I enjoyed showcasing this form of traditional sports at various events and cultural festivals to spread cultural appreciation. It is also my passion to foster love for Wushu in young children by teaching them wushu at the Oregon Hope Chinese School. I hope they would benefit physically and mentally by practicing the sports.

Last summer my interest in medicine and biotechnology led me to volunteer at a biomedical research lab at UC San Francisco. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work with the lab members on a project to develop a targeted monoclonal antibody therapeutic and to learn about biomedical research in drug development.

I greatly appreciate the opportunity to serve as MC for the 2025 Chinese Festival at Pioneer Courthouse Square. Through this role, I helped share and celebrate Chinese tradition with the broader community, encouraging greater cultural awareness and appreciation. This experience allowed me to actively promote appreciation of Chinese heritage while strengthening connections between Portland’s youth and Chinese American communities."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Noah Von Dem Bruch.
