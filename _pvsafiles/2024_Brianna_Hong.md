# Brianna Hong - Gold Award

**School: BASE**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 133.5**  

Brianna Hong, a sixth grader attending BASE, where for the past two years, I have had the privilege of being a part of the OCC Diabolo Team which allowed me to step into the role of community aspirant.  This team has performed at various events, I enjoy these experiences as I continue to spread the word about the cultures and art of Diabolo.  I felt fulfilled in these joyful moments, at the same time the desire to help others and serve our community grew.  In my daily interactions, I strive to share the beauty of traditional Chinese culture and language with my classmates and friends. I have also volunteered to make outreach videos for other various clubs. 

Despite the joy I experienced, I know there are people less fortunate than me.  My heart goes to the people who live in hunger and isolation.  I participated in a winter drive the OCC program has provided, where I helped collect warm clothing and blankets for those in need. I am reminded that while we share a dream for a brighter future, there are  countless individuals who are just trying to survive another day. I empathize with them and hope I can do more to make a change. 

As I look to the future, I am determined to continue helping those in need, to make a difference.  This journey is an important part of my growth, shaping me into a more compassionate individual, while making me be appreciative and cherish what I have.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Brianna Hong.
