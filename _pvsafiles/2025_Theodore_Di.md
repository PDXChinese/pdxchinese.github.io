Theodore (Teddy) Di is a freshman at Crescent Valley High School in Corvallis, where he was recently elected 9th-grade Co-President.

Teddy began volunteering in second grade through the Corvallis Cub Scouts and later Boy Scouts. Since then, he has contributed extensively to the community through the Corvallis Youth Corps, supporting the South Corvallis Food Bank, Heartland Humane Society, Corvallis Parks and Recreation, Corvallis Fall Festival, and the Children’s Halloween Party, among many other events. He has also volunteered at his school and at the Willamette Chinese School. For the past several years, he has helped with fresh fruit drives for the Ronald McDonald House in the Portland area. His dedication to service has been recognized multiple times with the President’s Service Award, presented by Ashbrook Independent School.

Beyond volunteer work, Teddy is an accomplished musician and athlete. He has served as principal trumpet player in both the Willamette Junior Honor Symphony and the Corvallis Youth Symphony for the past four years and was recently selected for the Oregon High School All-State Music program. Teddy has been a competitive swimmer with the Corvallis Aquatic Team for four years, ranking in the top five in Oregon in 2024 and competing at the regional level. He also played soccer with the Oregon Valley Futbol Alliance for seven years, serving as team captain and leading his team to multiple state level championships. Additionally, he continues to take professional-quality sports photographs for various teams at Crescent Valley High School. Teddy hopes to use his passions for music and sports to continue serving and supporting his community in the future.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Theodore Di.
