# Briana Sun - Gold Award

**School: Westview High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 210**  

"I'm Briana Sun, a sophomore at Westview High School. I enjoy embroidering and writing in my free time. Some fun facts about me is that I'm a Gold Key recipient from the Scholastic Writing and Art awards and I enjoy interacting and helping children, volunteering at THPRD regularly. I am a violinist in the WYCO community orchestra and a Committee Chair in Oregon Model UN. I'm also a co-founder and outreach coordinator for Grassroots Gallery, a project to empower voices through art and expression. 
"

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Briana Sun.
