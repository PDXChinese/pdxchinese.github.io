"Growing up, I regularly attended community events where I watched volunteers dedicate their time to helping those in need. Seeing their selflessness at such a young age inspired me to develop a deep appreciation for service. Over the years, this exposure shaped my belief that giving back is an essential part of building a strong community. As I got older, I began searching for ways to contribute in meaningful ways. My journey into volunteering started with opportunities that allowed me to combine my passions with service. One of my favorite activities has been demonstrating my FTC team’s robot to kids across the state. These demonstrations not only sparked excitement about STEM but also showed younger students what they could achieve with curiosity and perseverance. I also spent several summers teaching robotics at youth camps. In these camps, I guided students through hands-on projects that introduced them to engineering and problem-solving. My work with young learners reaffirmed my commitment to sharing knowledge and empowering others. Beyond STEM outreach, I dedicated time to supporting my broader community. I volunteered at the Oregon Food Bank, where I helped distribute food to families facing hardship. Each shift reminded me of the importance of compassion and collective effort. Through every experience, I have grown more determined to continue serving others and making a positive impact wherever I can."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Kevin Dai.
