# Sabrina Yu - Silver Award

**School: Bridlemile Elementary School**  
**Category: Kids (5-10 years old)**  
**Hours: 63**  

My name is Sabrina, I am a 5th grader In Bridlemile ES, I have only volunteered for one year but am very interested in OCC. I play the Chinese Yo-yo and guitar. One thing about me is in my free time I play outside with my friends or I read, but my favorite is Graphic novels, In my school I am in leadership program and there I developed more leadership skills to use them to help communicate with others like my yo-yo team. I love volunteering because when I am volunteering we get to go to places like Lan Su Chinese garden and the Oregon Zoo, there I taught others how to play with the Yo-yo and fold Origami cranes, dragons and many more! I am very thankful for the people that can make Occ a place where you are welcome there and can experience Chinese culture. I hope that we can keep this going and I hope that there will be more people who can make cultures like this keep on going no matter where they are or who they are.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Sabrina Yu.
