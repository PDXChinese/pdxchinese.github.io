# Jenny Jiang - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 151**  

As Jenny explored different ways to volunteer, she realized that volunteering with children always put a smile on her face! She is a mentor for OHSU’s Science Ambassadors program, where she pairs up with a fifth grader. They do hands-on science activities throughout the year, like making a candy DNA strand. She loves developing a strong bond with her fifth-grade buddy. When she was around her buddy’s age, she went to play at the Portland Children’s Museum. To return to a place that gave her joy, she interacts with the children there. Jenny assists the kids at the Clay Studio and reads aloud picture books at the Treehouse area. She also uses her art skills to make youth happy by face-painting on them! Jenny has been face painting children from ages five to twelve at THPRD’s concerts. She wanted to spread the experience of volunteering with youth to her classmates, so she co-founded an after school club called [Helping Hands](https://sunsethelpinghands.weebly.com/). Every month, her club members volunteer with diverse age groups in our community: children and senior citizens in memory care. In the past, they have done trivia, bingo, arts and crafts, swimming, baking, and storytelling to enrich the children’s and seniors’ lives. Not only does she love to interact with youth, but she also loves to educate them. This past summer, she coordinated a virtual Intro to Web Design boot camp for middle schoolers, leading everything from first advertising the class to preparing the lessons and checking the homework. Throughout this adventure, Jenny has learned to appreciate the lively energy of youth.  

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jenny Jiang.
