# Elise Then - Bronze Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 57**  

"I am currently a freshman at Sunset High School. I enjoy volunteering in my community. I volunteered at a tennis camp and helped the kids learn the basics of tennis skills. I played various games with the kids to make tennis fun and enjoyable. I also love cooking and baking. I volunteered in a cooking camp and taught kids new recipes from different cultures. I also instructed them to practice safety in the kitchen and cooking techniques."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Elise Then.
