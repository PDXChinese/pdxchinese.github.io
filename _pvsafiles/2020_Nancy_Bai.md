# Ruolan Nancy Bai - Gold Award

**School: Sunset High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 102**  

Nancy is a Junior at Sunset High School. She came to the United States in 7th grade
and was facing huge challenges on both language and cultural differences. She had received a lot
of help on her way, she has always been appreciative and had been waiting to give back to the
community when she can. She and her friends tutored middle school students for the math
competitions during COVID-19. She had also performed Guzheng at the Lansu garden and
multiply senior centers, spreading Chinese culture and bring them enjoyments. She believes that
if we received help from others, we should give back. It’s just like a bank account, whenever you
take out money, there became less money in the account, if you keep taking out and not putting
in, eventually, there will be no more money left. She knows that we have to give back. Maybe
not everything we do will directly affect those who helped us, and it doesn’t matter how small
we are helping, having the heart to give back is what matters.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Nancy Bai.
