# Ashley Fong - Gold Award

**School: Hosford Middle School**

**Hours: 196**  

"My name is Ashley Fong, I am 13 years old and I am currently in the 8th grade. I was first introduced into volunteering from my mother and her peers, they have many volunteering communities in performing, helping elders, and supporting the people in need. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to volunteer because I believe in the power of giving back to my community and making a difference in people's lives. I've always been interested in supporting people in need by joining the homeless shelter community with 8 other families to serve the homeless community once a month, I have been in this community for 3 years soon to be 4 years, and I have performed for people hoping to teach younger and older generations about our culture by joining the hanfu group community that has 7 members. Volunteering feels like the best way to move beyond just thinking about it and actually start contributing my talent and energy. I am eager to gain new skills, meet new people, and use my energy to support a cause that is truly important."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Ashley Fong.
