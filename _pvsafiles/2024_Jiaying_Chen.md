# Jiaying Chen - Silver Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 79**  

Hello! My name is Jiaying, but I go by Sirena. I am currently a sophomore at Lincoln High School. At OCC, I volunteer as a guitar teacher for both the adult and youth guitar clubs. In 2023-2024, I was the founder and lead teacher of the OCC youth club. I mainly teach 7-14 year olds, and they are going on to perform recitals and potentially at OCC hosted events. Mainly, I write lesson plans, teach in class, and make practice videos for the students to follow along at home. Personally, I've played guitar for seven years and have performed on many stages. Outside of guitar, I enjoy writing and reading.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Jiaying Chen.
