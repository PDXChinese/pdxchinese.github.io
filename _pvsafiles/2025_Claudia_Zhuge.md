Claudia is currently a junior at Sunset High School. She has been a member of the Jade Dance Team since July 2022 and also manages their Instagram and TikTok, taking the responsibility of outreach leader. She loves being able to share Chinese cultural dance on social media to connect with the community. Claudia also is always proud to see the number of meals she helped prepare after every shift at the Oregon Food Bank. She is grateful to be able to make a difference at Northwest Children’s Outreach and make clothing and toy packages for kids in need as well.

She also has been enjoying regularly volunteering with Red Cross Club at her school since freshman year.  After school she helps the club and contributes with first aid kit drives, cards for veterans, fundraising, and clothing and necessity drives.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Claudia Zhuge.
