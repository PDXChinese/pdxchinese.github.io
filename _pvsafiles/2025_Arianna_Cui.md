# Arianna Cui - Gold Award

"Over the past year, I have committed myself to meaningful community service focused on helping vulnerable populations and supporting local
environmental stewardship.

One of my primary volunteer activities is serving meals at the Clark Center homeless shelter as part of the Oregon Chinese Coalition (OCC). I participate regularly—about twice a month—helping prepare and serve hot meals to residents. Through this experience, I have learned the importance of compassion, consistency, and teamwork. Every visit reminds me how small actions can make a real difference for people experiencing hardship.

In addition to serving at the shelter, I also volunteer through the THPRD RISE Youth Leadership Program. I support community events, assist instructors during youth summer camps, and help create a positive and inclusive environment for younger participants.

I also care deeply about the environment. This year, I joined two restoration projects at the Tualatin River National Wildlife Refuge, where I worked alongside volunteers to remove invasive species and protect native plants. These hands-on activities strengthened my appreciation for nature and taught me how community efforts can support local ecosystems.

Through all of these experiences, I have grown more confident, responsible, and aware of my role in the community. I hope to continue volunteering, learning, and contributing in ways that help others and improve the world around me."

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Arianna Cui.
