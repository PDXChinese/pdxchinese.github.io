My name is Gloria (Ruoyan) Zhou. Im currently a senior at Lincoln High School. I am a passionate, creative, resilient and compassionate student. I have been consistently involved in community service across various organizations, including Oregon Chinese Coalition, Chinese Friendship Association of Portland, Oregon Food Bank, Neighborhood Youth Leadership Committee, and etc. I became an active member in the Youth Mental Health Club funded by CPFA. She participated in panel discussions, where I explored various topics that concerned todays youth. I created the flyer for a Mental Health Talk, where I presented, along with my peer, our research to dozens of families to raise awareness of youth mental health. In addition, I also independently led the project of advocating for food banks to help end hunger. In summary, I am a passionate, creative, resilient and compassionate student. My experiences with mental health advocacy, community service, and leadership have shaped me into a well-rounded individual with a deep sense of responsibility and purpose.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Ruoyan Zhou.
