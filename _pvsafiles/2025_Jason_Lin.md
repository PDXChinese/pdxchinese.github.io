# Jason Lin - Silver Award

**School: Meadow Park Middle School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 58**  

Jason is a 7th grader at Meadow Park Middle School who is passionate about making a positive difference in his community. He is devoted to helping others and believes that even small acts of kindness can have a big impact. Whether it’s volunteering, supporting classmates, or lending a hand to neighbors, Jason is always eager to contribute and inspire those around him.

One of Jason’s greatest interests is teaching STEM subjects. He enjoys sharing his love for science, technology, engineering, and math with others, encouraging curiosity and problem-solving skills. Jason often looks for opportunities to explain concepts in creative ways, helping his peers in his robotics team see how STEM connects to everyday life and future possibilities.

Outside of school and community involvement, Jason is very active. He enjoys biking, swimming, and playing basketball, which keep him energized and teach him the value of discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. These activities not only strengthen his physical health but also reflect the enthusiasm and determination he brings into all areas of his life.

Jason is motivated by a desire to grow, learn, and inspire others. He looks forward to connecting with people who share similar values and interests, and he is excited about the opportunities ahead to continue making a positive impact both in his school and in the wider community.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Jason Lin.
