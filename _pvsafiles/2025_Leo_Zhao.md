# Leo Zhao - Bronze Award

**School: Camas High School**  
**Category: Young Adults (16-21)**  
**Hours: 110**  

Leo hosted online classes teaching students about the programming language Java. Teaching and educating other people about what Leo is interested in has been something he has wanted to do for a long time and he was inspired to share his knowledge with those around him. In addition to tasks such as grading homework and hosting office hours on the weekend, many of the resources used in the class have been curated and edited by him. Leo understands that some of the material may be a little complex to understand, but he hopes that all the students he has worked with have learned something that could help them achieve their goals and complete their own projects in the future. Throughout Leo's experience working with his students, he has come to value the importance of good communication skills in both text and voice, and he hopes that he will continue to improve his skills as he continues to teach and grow as a person. He is proud to have been able to serve and impact his community in a positive way, and is very thankful to everyone who has helped him along this journey. In addition to his work as Java teacher, Leo also became a member of the Youth Commission; an advisory group providing a youth-oriented point of view to the Clark County Council and various community organizations, working with topics such as mental health, healing, and intergenerational connection.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Leo Zhao.
