"Hi, my name is Brady Zhang and I love helping people. I enjoy volunteering because by participating, I can not only help those in need, but also learn and grow a lot myself. I will definitely keep volunteering in the future!

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to recognize the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the Community Volunteer Service Award (CVSA) to Brady Zhang.
