# Noah Von Dem Bruch - Gold Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 125.75**  

I am a junior at Lincoln High School. This year, I have been offering tech support for seniors at local residential homes for the Lincoln Support and Services Club. While helping the elderly with their various (and sometimes frustrating) tech problems, I also get inspired by conversing with them to listen to the rich life stories and values that they wish to share.
I have also practiced Chinese Martial Arts, known as Wushu, ever since I was young. This art has instilled in me the importance of respect, perseverance, confidence, and compassion. I have performed at many cultural festivals and celebrations to spread cultural appreciation and promote my passion for Wushu. By teaching wushu to children at the Oregon Hope Chinese School, I strive to help them develop these same skills while benefiting from the sport's mental and physical discipline. Moreover, I wish for them to bring awareness about the sport of Wushu to others so that many can experience the beauty of the sport.
I also participate in many miscellaneous volunteering activities including managing participants at the Portland Marathon, facilitating speeches at the Multnomah County Youth Summit, planting at the Tualatin National Wildlife Refuge, and many more. Through these activities, I hope to not only embrace new perspectives but also strengthen the voices of the youth and bring awareness about wildlife protection.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Noah Von Dem Bruch.
