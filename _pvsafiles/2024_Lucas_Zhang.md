# Lucas Zhang - Gold Award

**School: Catlin Gabel**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 144.5**  

Lucas Zhang is a freshman at Catlin Gabel, and he has a particular passion for history.
Over this year, he has engaged in a plethora of activities. Several times this year, he has helped host by emceeing several Chinese-culture-related events (i.e. Beaverton Welcome Week, the Chinese Cultural Festival, etc.), helping other young peoples’ potential on the stage be realized and thrive. 
In addition, he has consistently participated in serving those who are less fortunate and houseless through OCC and Portland Transition Projects through the preparation and serving of meals.
Additionally, Lucas has helped the community online be a more secure place through his participation in the security assessment for several local small businesses and nonprofit organizations with over 7000 users — which helped business owners from potential financial disasters resulting from the cyber attacks.
Finally, this year — as he has in the past — Lucas has spread his interest in history throughout the community. He strongly believes that history can be both a subject of great importance and a tool one can wield academically to achieve great things.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Lucas Zhang.
