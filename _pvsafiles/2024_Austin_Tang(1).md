Austin, a freshman at Westview High School, co-founded Puddletown Chess, a nonprofit organization that helps expand access to chess across Oregon. He is a passionate chess player and dedicates much of his time teaching chess, organizing tournaments, and hosting free monthly webinars for players of all levels. Austin believes chess helps develop critical skills like patience, critical thinking, and resilience, and he works to create a supportive environment for players to grow. His contributions have made Puddletown Chess a key resource for the local   chess community, encouraging both new and experienced players to improve their skills.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Austin Tang.
