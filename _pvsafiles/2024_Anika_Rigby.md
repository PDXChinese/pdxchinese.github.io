# Anika Rigby - Gold Award

**School: Lincoln High School**  
**Category: Teens (11-15)**  
**Hours: 163.65**  

I am a sophomore at Lincoln High School with a deep passion for community engagement. I take pride in being able to utilize my language skills to help teach US naturalization classes at Mission: Citizen, fostering connections with students. As a Jade Dance Team member, I can combine my love for dance and my commitment to spreading cultural awareness.

In my role as an Oregon Zoo Wildlife Leader, I work to highlight the need for conservation and saving endangered species. At my school, I am a part of Red Cross, Model UN, Constitution Team, and Asian Student Union, while I lead Pink Valley Dance Team.

I love being able to help plan or support fundraisers, and hope to inspire others to become more globally minded and to take action. An important factor to my success is self advocacy and being able to voice my concerns, taking the initiative to fix problems myself. I am so grateful to have the opportunity to create a more inclusive and welcoming community. I strive to create more change through collaboration and compassion.

Oregon Chinese Coalition is proud to join the President of the United States in recognizing the volunteers who consistently take the time to make a difference in the lives of others. Therefore, it is a great honor to present the President's Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) to Anika Rigby.
